# Vox Explainer Method

A [Claude](https://claude.com) skill that turns a single sentence into a complete Vox-style paper-collage animated video — researched script, per-clip prompts, every image and clip generated, chained into one continuous animation — without you ever leaving the chat.

It does two things:

- **Make ad videos** — Vox Style Ad Animation for your product or offer, ready to run paid or drop organic.
- **Make explainers for faceless YouTube channels** — editorial storytelling that sells nothing.

You give it a topic or a product. The skill walks a fixed gate flow — content mode, a quick research pass, script and prompt approval — then generates every clip through the [MaxFusion](https://maxfusion.ai) MCP (Google Omni, 10-second clips) and returns the finished clips in chat. The consistency trick: it extracts the last frame of each finished clip and passes it as the reference into the next clip's generation, which is why the result plays as one continuous animation instead of disconnected AI shots.

## Examples

| | |
| --- | --- |
| ![coffee](examples/coffee-preview.gif) | ![eels](examples/eel-preview.gif) |
| *coffee explainer* | *eel explainer* |
| ![eggs](examples/final-preview.gif) | ![painkillers](examples/painkillers-preview.gif) |
| *egg explainer* | *painkillers explainer* |

## What the skill does

- **Two content modes, chosen at intake** — a product/offer **AD** written in 9-figure direct-response style, or a **PURE EXPLAINER** that sells nothing (editorial storytelling, faceless-channel ready, no CTA by default).
- **A quick research pass before writing** — a hard-budgeted web pass (snippets only, under 5 tool calls) so the script carries specific, current substance instead of generic filler.
- **Writes the full voice-over script** — emotion-first, benefit-driven in AD mode; editorial in EXPLAINER mode — then splits it into 10-second clips with internal timeframes.
- **Builds every clip prompt in the locked Vox visual system** — torn-paper collage, cutout elements, one locked font per video, style wording identical across clips so the video reads as one piece.
- **Generates everything itself through the MaxFusion MCP** — live capability check first, then image references, then every clip via Google Omni. No canvas, no UI, no timeline — the whole run happens in chat.
- **Chains clips into one continuous animation** — extracts the last frame of each finished clip at 9.9s and verifies it is passed as a reference into the next clip's generation call before submitting.
- **Handles real products and mascots** — your product image is uploaded and attached as a true generation reference in every clip where it appears; photorealistic mascots are composited so the person stays a real photograph inside the collage.
- **Delivers finished clips in chat** — each one returned as an inline widget as it completes.

## Requirements

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** (or any agent that can follow the skill file).
- **[MaxFusion](https://maxfusion.ai) MCP** — required. All image and video generation runs through it; the skill does not work without it.

## Install

1. Drop `SKILL.md` into your skills directory:

```
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/vox-animated-ad-mcp
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/vox-animated-ad-mcp/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holy-templar/vox-animated-ad-mcp/main/SKILL.md
```

2. Connect the MaxFusion MCP server:

```
claude mcp add --transport http maxfusion https://mcp.maxfusion.ai/mcp
```

   The first call will ask you to authenticate with your MaxFusion account.

3. In Claude Code, say something like:

> *make a vox explainer about how coffee conquered the world*

The skill takes it from there: content mode, research, script, prompt approval, then generation.
