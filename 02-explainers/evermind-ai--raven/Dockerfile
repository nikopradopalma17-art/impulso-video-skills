# Raven in one image: the Python engine, the built web page, and the nginx that
# serves it.
#
# Why one image and not two. The engine binds its HTTP surface to 127.0.0.1
# (raven/cli/_gateway_page.py and raven/cli/serve_commands.py both call
# `web.TCPSite(runner, "127.0.0.1", port)`), so a reverse proxy in a second
# container has no address to reach it on. nginx therefore shares the engine's
# network namespace by living beside it, which is the same answer ragflow's
# image gives to the same shape. Splitting the two into separate services needs
# a bind address the engine does not offer yet.
#
# Build:
#   docker build -t raven:local .
#   docker build -t raven:local --build-arg RAVEN_EXTRAS="channels,tools,sandbox" .
#
# Run: see docker/docker-compose.yml.

# so both callers get a wrong answer that looks like a normal one: the lock
# holder reads as absent, so a running server is invisible and a second one is
# started onto a lock it then dies on; and a stop declares STOPPED on its first
# poll and unlinks the pidfile while the process is still draining. `top`,
# `kill` and `free` come with the package, which is what an operator in
# `docker exec` was reaching for.
#
# lsof is the same module's lock-holder probe. Its port lookup falls back to

# LibreOffice, because the page cannot draw a .docx, .xlsx or .pptx and the
# gateway converts those to PDF to show them (raven/rpc/pdf_preview.py through
# raven/utils/office.py). Without it every office file in a knowledge base --
# and every deck -- answers the viewer with "LibreOffice is not installed",
# which is a hosted image telling its user to go and install something on it.
#
# The three app packages rather than the `libreoffice` metapackage: the filters
# for Writer, Calc and Impress formats are what a conversion needs, and the
# metapackage adds Base, Draw, Math and a JRE that no conversion here opens.
# --no-install-recommends holds that line.
#
# Fonts are not optional decoration. A slim image ships none, and LibreOffice
# renders every glyph it cannot find as a box -- so a Chinese document, which
# this project expects, would convert to a PDF of tofu. Noto CJK covers those
# and DejaVu the Latin text beside them.
#
# It is the largest thing in this image (roughly 500 MB with the fonts). Build
# with --build-arg RAVEN_OFFICE=0 for a deployment that will never preview an
# office file; the viewer then says what is missing and how to add it, which is
