"""Every method in the RPC contract must have a handler.

`skill.*` and `mcp.*` are declared in `models.py` METHOD_MODELS and in
`rpc-schema/openrpc.json` but no register call backs them, so calling them
in a real `raven tui` returns -32601. That gap predates this test and is
allowlisted below rather than silently tolerated: the point of the test is that
no NEW method joins it.

Checking only that direction is what let nine ui-tui-invoked names ship with no
handler at all, none of them ever declared in the contract this test reads. The
caller-side guard at the bottom of this file closes it by scanning what the
client calls. `skills.manage` was the example this docstring used to cite as the
visible cost; it now has a handler, and the guard is what keeps the next one
from repeating it.

The dispatcher here is built with a stub for every optional dependency, because
several groups are capability-gated rather than unimplemented:
`register_aligned_methods_except_system` skips `turn.*` when `emitter` is None,
and `approval.respond` / `confirm.respond` / `clarify.respond` when their broker
is None. Passing no kwargs makes those seven look unimplemented and pushes them
into the allowlist, which is the opposite of what this guard is for. The stubs
are never called - registration only stores them.
