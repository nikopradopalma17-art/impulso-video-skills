"""A refusal carries the reason it happened.

Four different causes -- a denied pattern, a recursive delete, a power-off, a
command that cannot be parsed -- all reached the user as one sentence:
"Command blocked by safety guard (policy evaluation failed)". In the session
this work came from, that is what the user asked about four times, and what the
model then guessed wrong about twice.

The decision itself is unchanged here. What changes is that the rule which
fired travels with it, so the tool result, and later the trace and the UI, stop
having to infer a cause from a generic string.
