"""The exec tool's record of what a command wrote: its directory either side.

A command returns its output and nothing else, so the tool lists the directory
it runs in before and after, and -- where a shadow repo covers the directory --
stages the tree first so a rewritten or removed file can be shown against what
it held. The shadow repo here is a stand-in: these are the tool's decisions
(when to stage, when not to run, what to hand back), and the real repo has its
own tests in ``test_runtime_checkpoint.py``.
