"""Cross-entrypoint parity for the assembly-door call.

Three entrypoints used to hand-write their own ``AgentLoop(...)`` call, and a
kwarg added to one and forgotten in the others failed *silently* -- the omitted
feature simply did not exist in that surface (``third_party_subagents`` missing
from two surfaces and ``plugin_tools`` missing from the gateway both shipped
that way). ``build_runtime`` dissolved the three copies: the cargo mapping now
exists once, in ``raven/core/runtime.py``, and parity of everything derived
from config holds by construction.

What can still drift is what the entrances still own -- the transport-side
``TurnPolicy`` / ``HostWiring`` fields and the identity handles they pass to
the door. This file keeps that remainder honest, and keeps the door singular:
an ``AgentLoop(...)`` call reappearing in an entrance is the regression this
guard exists to catch now.

So every difference has to be *declared* here, with the reason. An undeclared
one turns this red. Shrinking :data:`LEDGER` (i.e. fixing a gap) is also a
deliberate edit, because a stale entry turns it red too.

The check is static (``ast`` over the call site) rather than a runtime
kwarg-capture: ``gateway()`` cannot be driven under unit test at all -- it
builds ChannelManager / Cron / Heartbeat stacks whose shutdown paths assume a
running event loop (see the note in ``test_cli_gateway_commands.py``). Reading
the source is the only way to cover all three the same way.
