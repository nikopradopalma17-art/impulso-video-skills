"""What the deck is for, and the two checks that make agreeing it worth doing.

The point of this stage is not that the model asks a polite question. It is that
the answer binds: the page budget is checked against the built deck and the
language against what the pages say. A confirmed decision that binds nothing is
worse than never asking, because the user believes they decided something.
