"""Raven's A2A server over a real socket, driven by hand-built requests.

The handler under test is the real ``DefaultRequestHandler`` assembled by
``raven.a2a.runtime.build_request_handler``, so a pass here is proof about the
SDK integration on the *server* side.

It is not proof of conformance, and the difference matters: the requests here
are written by hand and the frames read back with the same assumptions that
wrote them, so this file agrees with whatever raven happens to encode. Three
wire-level disagreements passed through it -- a missing required field, a
missing response envelope, and a reply read from the wrong arm of a oneof --
because the streaming test counts ``data:`` frames without parsing any of them.
``tests/test_a2a_interop.py`` is the one that points raven's own client at
raven's own server, and it lives in the default pytest scope because
``norecursedirs`` keeps this directory out of it.
