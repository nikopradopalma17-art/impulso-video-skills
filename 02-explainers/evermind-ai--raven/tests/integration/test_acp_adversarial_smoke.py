"""``raven acp`` under a client that is legal and unhelpful.

Every case here is something a real client does -- string request ids, a version
of the wrong type, two requests in flight, a frame split across writes -- and
each one is a place an agent can be accidentally right. The point of driving the
real binary is that none of it is mocked: real pipes, real framing, real
concurrency, real teardown.

The agent home is a throwaway directory, which also means no provider is
configured. That is deliberate rather than a limitation: it makes the run
reproducible, and it puts the "a turn could not start" path -- which must still
answer with a stop reason rather than an error -- on the happy path of the test
instead of behind a credential.

Marked ``integration`` because it spawns the binary.
