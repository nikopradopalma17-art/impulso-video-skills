"""Raven's ACP client verifies Raven's ACP agent, with no new code on either side.

``capabilities.verify_agent`` is the probe that decides whether a configured
agent is usable: it launches the executable, does two round trips
(``initialize``, then ``session/new`` in a throwaway directory), classifies the
result into one of four states, and never raises. It is duck-typed on the config
object, so pointing it at ``raven acp`` costs a five-field namespace -- and what
comes back is a conformance assertion written by the side that had to work with
real third-party agents rather than by the side being tested.

That asymmetry is the value. Every other test here was written against raven's
own reading of the specification; this one is checked by a reader that was built
from measurements of hermes and codex-acp, and it fails the same way it would
fail for them.

Marked ``integration`` because it launches the binary twice over.
