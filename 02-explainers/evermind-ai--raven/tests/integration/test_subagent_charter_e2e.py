"""A charter, end to end: written by a host, carried on a dispatch, held to by a turn.

Each unit of this is tested beside its own code. What is only true of the whole
is that the pieces are actually joined -- that a brief written on one side
reaches a tool call on the other, and that a turn carrying none is the turn it
was before charters existed. Those joins are what this file holds:

- the host's generated table produces a payload, and the transport asks for it;
- the worker's ACP entry stages it, and the turn consumes it once;
- the assembled prompt carries the brief, and the tool registry refuses on it.
