"""End-to-end checks on the bundled tracing viewer's read path.

Spawns the real Node viewer against a synthetic state dir and drives it over
HTTP, because the behaviour under test lives entirely in
``raven/cli/tracing_viewer/*.js`` and none of it is reachable from Python.

Two properties are pinned here, both of which a plausible refactor can break
silently:

* **Where logs are looked for.** The reader visits the active log and the
  ``archive/`` subtree, and nothing else under ``logs/`` -- notably not
  ``audit-artifacts/``, which holds one file per captured payload and grows to
  hundreds of thousands of entries. A reader that recurses all of ``logs/``
  still passes every functional assertion while taking seconds per request.
* **The tree does not carry a second copy of every span.** ``trace.tree`` is
  nesting plus ids; the spans themselves travel once, in ``trace.spans``. A
  refactor that nests whole spans again passes every render but doubles a
  payload already measured in hundreds of megabytes.
* **A deposit is found wherever the engine writes it.** The walk that feeds the
  ``memory.store`` join skips directories on a denylist of engine state, not an
  allowlist of known deposit directories. A deposit directory's name is not
  knowable from the type map -- agent cases land in ``.cases`` and skills in
  ``skills/``, neither of which appears there -- so an allowlist drops them
  silently, which is exactly what the test below plants.
* **The sharded reader agrees with the whole-corpus one.** The session list and
  a session's detail are built from per-file indexes; ``/api/data`` still builds
  everything at once. Where they disagree the sharded answer is wrong, and the
  disagreement is silent, so the tests below compare them rather than asserting
  a shape.
* **Snapshot reuse stays correct.** Rebuilding reads the whole retained
  history, so an unchanged tree is answered from a held copy. The failure mode
  that matters is the opposite of a slow one: a cache that never notices new
  spans. A reader that has just appended one sees it within a couple of polls
  (the refresh runs behind the response, so the first poll after a write may
  still answer from the previous snapshot).
