"""How many renders one `ppt_build` reply really carries, through the real renderer.

Everything under `tests/ppt` builds the tool with a fake `views`, so a batch is a
list the fixture wrote down rather than pictures a model can look at. Two constants
carried this number once and drifted to 1 and 3 without a test noticing, and the
unit tests could not notice: they read the same list the fake produced. So this one
converts a real deck with LibreOffice and counts the image blocks in the reply.
