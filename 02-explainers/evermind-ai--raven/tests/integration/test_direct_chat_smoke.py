"""Direct chat end to end: switch in, follow up, hand off.

Uses a real ``AgentLoop``, a real ``SubagentManager``, a real registry file and
real record directories. The only stub is the LLM provider -- this is about the
wiring between the sub-agent manager, the turn pipeline and the handoff, not
about model quality.

The unit tests each stub the layer below them, so nothing else proves the four
phases fit together: a direct turn that never reaches the transcript, a record
directory the handoff can name, replayed state that makes the second turn a
continuation, and a block that lands on the next main-agent turn.
