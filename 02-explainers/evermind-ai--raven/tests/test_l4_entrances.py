"""The L4 constitution, pinned.

L4 = the entrance layer: whoever calls the kernel. Three runnable clauses:
1. The kernel has zero knowledge of its callers -- no inner package imports
   any surface package, ever.
2. A NEW entrance needs nothing but inward imports: a ~25-line surface builds
   a Scheduler, submits a TurnRequest, and receives deliverables -- without
   touching or knowing cli/rpc/acp.
3. Every turn produces EXACTLY one terminal event (the L0 handover: consumers
   key their per-turn release on it; zero would leak the slot, two would test
   release idempotence in anger).
