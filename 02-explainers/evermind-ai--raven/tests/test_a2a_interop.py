"""raven's own A2A client against raven's own A2A server, over a real socket.

Both halves ship in this repo and neither had ever been pointed at the other.
Every other test on either side supplies the counterpart itself: the client
tests answer from a hand-written `httpx` transport that accepts whatever it is
given, and the server tests build their requests by hand and read the frames
back with the same assumptions that wrote them. Each side therefore agreed with
its own idea of the protocol, and three separate disagreements survived a
hundred passing tests -- a missing required field, a missing wire envelope, and
a reply read from an arm the server never uses.

Only the agent turn is stubbed. The credential resolution, the card fetch, the
SDK client, the JSON-RPC framing, the SSE stream and the routes are all real.
