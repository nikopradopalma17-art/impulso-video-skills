"""A campaign declares which shape its target has, instead of always a number.

``metric`` and ``goal`` were required of every campaign, and not every campaign
has a number that ranks one round above another. Measured 2026-08-21 across seven
campaigns an arm declared for itself, three invented one to get past the
requirement:

  dam-break-lega    completion max   the task was "run to endTime, results usable"
  dam-break-legb2   completion max   the same
  beam-limit-load   total_load max   total_load is the load it CHOOSES each round,
                                     not something the solver reports, so best()
                                     was permanently None

The other four had a real number and got it right -- max_penetration min, l2_error
min, elapsed_seconds min twice -- which is the point. Reading the owner's intent is
what the loop is good at; being made to state it in a shape the task does not have
is what produced the fiction.
