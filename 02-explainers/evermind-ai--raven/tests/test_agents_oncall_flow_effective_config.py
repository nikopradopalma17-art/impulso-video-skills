"""A key can be written, echoed back, and still do nothing.

The CFD divergence leg passed ``deltaT`` alongside ``maxCo=0.5`` and
``maxAlphaCo=0.5``. The run script sets ``adjustTimeStep no`` whenever a
``deltaT`` arrives, and under fixed stepping those two ceilings take no part --
but the job log echoed all three, so the arm believed the Courant number was
capped at 0.5 and delivered a conclusion on that basis. Measured maximum: 2.81,
above 1 for 716 of 10000 steps. It reported the limit it set, not the limit that
held.

Two mechanisms, split by who can know what:

  - comparing the request against the run is the same operation in every domain,
    so it lives here and interprets nothing;
  - which key was inert, and why, is solver semantics. Only the job knows, so the
    job says it and this layer prints it back word for word.
