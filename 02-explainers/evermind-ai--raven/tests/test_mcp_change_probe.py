"""The change probe and the unload edge, for the manager alone.

``config_changed`` is the cheap gate in front of ``apply_config``: everything
that can fire on a timer asks it first, so an unchanged config costs a dict
comparison instead of a reconnect storm. Its branches are the ones a poll can
get wrong -- a settled removal must read as no work without hiding a later
record that really did change, and a server parked in ``error`` must not be
retried on every tick.

These lived in a file about tool retirement, which no longer exists: a
withdrawn tool is unregistered outright now, and the miss itself names both
readings (see ``ToolRegistry.execute``). The probe and the teardown edge are
not about that, so they are here.
