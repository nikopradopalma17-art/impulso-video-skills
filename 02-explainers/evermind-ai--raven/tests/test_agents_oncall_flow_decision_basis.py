"""Every decision has to cite a reading taken since the previous one.

Round 3 measured the gap this closes: the loop woke, read in-flight scores of
0.287-0.298 against a 0.3674 starting value it had been given, and its next
action was to schedule another 30 minutes of waiting. Waiting cost nothing and
recorded nothing.

The requirement is deliberately on all three decisions -- wait, kill, submit a
further round. Putting it only on waiting would add friction to one side of a
choice and none to the others, which is a push toward the others.
