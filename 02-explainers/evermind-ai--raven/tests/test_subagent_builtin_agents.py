"""Ownership across the built-in seed/override merge.

``merge_builtin_seeds`` applies a config row over a package seed field by field,
keeping only the fields that say something -- so the three states ``owns`` has
(undeclared, declared, explicitly nothing) have to survive a round trip through a
stored row, which arrives with every field populated. Undeclared has to inherit,
because a row written to retune ``skills`` must not strip a seed's ownership on
its way past; explicitly empty has to stick, because that is how an agent is
opted out.
