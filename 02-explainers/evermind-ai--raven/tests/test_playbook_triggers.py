"""The L1 vocabulary guards, and that no path can write the index around them.

An L1 entry is a standing cost: it is substring-matched against every inbound
message for as long as the playbook exists, and each hit buys a gate call. So
the guards are not advice to the author -- whoever proposes a word (a person, or
the generation model through the emit_playbook schema) goes through them.

CJK fixtures are written as unicode escapes to keep the source ASCII; they pin
that the guards handle Chinese entries (stop words, one-character entries,
full-width folding) with real CJK data.
