"""A failed trial is routed by whether its text states a cause, not by failing.

The wake message used to carry one failure branch: "if trials FAILED with a code
error in the trial script, do NOT rewrite the trial code yourself -- ops_finish
with outcome='failed' to hand it off." Sound advice, and the only named case, so
an unexplained death borrowed it.

Measured 2026-08-14, M3's third leg. A trial was killed from outside at 422s.
SIGKILL runs no ``finally``, so no result.json was written, and the process
backend fills ``error`` from ``tail -30 job.log``. For this training script that
tail is the checkpoint write from the last eval:

    Loading weights: 100%|##########| 310/310
    [transformers] `use_cache=True` is incompatible with gradient checkpointing.
    Writing model shards: 100%|##########| 1/1

No traceback, no exception, nothing that failed -- and the process stops right
after. The loop read the progress bars as the crash site, reported "a code-level
fault in the trial script / Loading weights stage", took the branch above, and
handed the campaign back with 88% of the budget unspent. Its own report said, in
the same breath, that training had been normal and the loss carried no NaN.

So the fix is not "try harder": the branch had no name for a death with no
stated cause, and the evidence surface reads like a cause either way. These
tests pin both halves of the split.

They assert on prompt text on purpose. The text is the contract the loop is
handed each wake; if it silently loses the unexplained case, the leg that
follows it looks like an agent that gave up.
