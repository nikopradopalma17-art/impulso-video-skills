"""Multi-turn DR: the gate, the memo, and the wrapper that makes them inert.

Two properties carry most of the weight here, and neither is about the happy path.

**Off means byte-identical, not "nearly".** Every DR reading in the ladder is turn
one of a fresh session, so this whole module has to be provably absent from a
measured arm. The tests assert that from both ends: the assembly does not build a
gate, and the wrapper is not applied, when ``conversation.enabled`` is false.

**Every classifier failure resolves to research.** A gate that errors, stalls,
truncates or answers in prose must produce a research turn, and it must say which
of those happened rather than reporting one indistinguishable "no". The two
mistakes are not symmetric - a needless research turn costs latency, a wrongly
skipped one answers a factual question from stale context in the same confident
voice - so the direction is tested once per failure mode, not once in general.
