# the right form and nothing about the forms it *uses*. A sample that read
# `picture_fit(slide, frame.body, PHOTO)` -- two arguments transposed and `theme`
# missing -- sat three lines under a correct table row and would raise TypeError for
# any author who copied it, which is what a sample is for.

# Bound and not executed: a sample draws on a slide and reads a theme that do not
# exist here. `bind` answers the whole question a copied call fails on -- too few
# arguments, too many, a keyword the helper does not take.
