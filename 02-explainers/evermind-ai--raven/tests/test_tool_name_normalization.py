"""A tool name an upstream sent is a key only after it is normalised.

An upstream returned tool names carrying a leading space. Raven used them as
registry keys unchanged, so the lookup missed and the call was refused -- and
because the name is also written back into the history, the bad one was
replayed to the model on every turn afterwards, which is why the model could
not correct it by reasoning about it.

Every exit that builds a `ToolCallRequest` out of upstream data is pinned, and
a guard test enumerates them from the source rather than trusting this list --
the first version of this change covered two of the four and said it covered
all of them. Replay is deliberately not one of them: it reconstructs a recorded
run, and normalising there would make a replay diverge from the run it replays.

The boundary is pinned too. Stripping surrounding whitespace is a fact (a
registry key is written in code and has none); folding case or interior spaces
would be a guess, and "that tool does not exist" is only worth something while
it is certain.
