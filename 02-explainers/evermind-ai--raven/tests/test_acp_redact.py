"""The redaction table: what it catches, what it leaves alone, and what it cannot.

An ACP payload is rendered in an editor and often kept in its transcript, so a
tool title, a permission prompt and an error message are all publishing surfaces.
Three claims are pinned here, and the third is the one most worth a test:

1. **It catches the four measured channels.** A command line with a header token,
   a result preview containing a key, an error string, an ``env`` dict.
2. **It leaves ordinary text alone.** A table that redacts ``set -e`` or a plain
   ``git clone`` URL makes every tool row unreadable, and an unreadable row is
   approved without being read -- which is worse than not redacting at all.
3. **It is not a scanner, and the gap has a name.** Only the capture group is
   replaced, so the shape survives. And a secret with no label and no vendor
   prefix passes through, which is stated as a test rather than left for somebody
   to discover.
