"""The metric name is resolved before the progress rendering that uses it.

Regression 2026-08-07: the resolution moved below `records = led.all()` so that a
campaign declaring no objective could be read from its records. The running-trial
series is labelled and filtered by that same name, and it renders above -- so it
was handed the empty string, and the loop saw

    , as logged: None:69.89 100:100 220:220 340:340

instead of the evaluation curve. Both arms of r15/r16 spent their first fifty
minutes writing "no nDCG eval results captured yet" while the job was writing
them all along. Cited from the tool's own output rather than from the code,
because the failure was visible only in what the loop was shown.
