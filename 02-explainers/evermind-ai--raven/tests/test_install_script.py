"""Tripwires for the two root installers (install.sh and install.ps1).

Both installers resolve the latest release from the release page redirect
and derive every other URL from that one directory: the wheel, the locked
constraints and raven-plugins.txt, the list of plugin wheels the release
ships beside raven. The list is what they hand to `uv tool install
--with-requirements`; nothing in either script knows a plugin's name or
guesses one from an asset list, and neither script calls the GitHub API.

The optional capability steps (the chromium download, the LibreOffice offer)
get pins of their own: they stay skippable via RAVEN_MINIMAL, they read the
interactive answer and sudo's password prompt from /dev/tty (stdin is the
script itself under `curl | sh`), and they stay above install.sh's closing
launch -- that call holds the terminal until Ctrl-C, so anything placed after
it would not run at all on a normal install.

install.ps1 mirrors the capability steps for Windows (Install-Browser,
Install-Office) and the closing launch (Start-Web): same decisions, same
degrade-loudly warns, with the /dev/tty gate traded for a console gate --
under `irm | iex` Read-Host still reads the console, but CI has none, so the
guard must make a non-interactive run skip the winget offer cleanly instead of
hanging on it.

Both launches obey the probe rule: the scripts are served from main and install
the latest release, which can predate a subcommand main already knows about
(`raven web` shipped after 0.1.13 did, and the install ended in "No such
command 'web'"). So every `raven <sub>` call is preceded by `raven <sub>
--help`, the probe's failure branch finishes on the one command every release
has, and neither the stop nor the page's own exit code becomes the script's.
