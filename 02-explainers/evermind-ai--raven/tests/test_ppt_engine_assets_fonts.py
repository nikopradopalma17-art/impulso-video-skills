"""Measurement fonts: the bundled ones are there, and an override takes.

Measurement is the reason these are bundled at all -- the same text has to come
out the same width on a dev machine and in an eval container, and a system font
that differs by a point release silently changes what fits on a page. So the
test that matters is that the packaged files exist and that resolution actually
reaches them rather than quietly landing on a system path.
