"""Prompt-mode graph composition (raven/playbook/prompt.py).

The CLI path for a ``mode: prompt`` playbook -- ``raven playbook run`` --
composes a graph through a forced tool call. What is
guarded here is that the two things the model is handed agree with each other and
with the node model: the schema attached to the call, and the prose that tells it
which fields to write. They disagreed once, and the failure was quiet: the schema
carried no fields at all, so the prose was the only guidance, and it named a
field the node model forbids.
