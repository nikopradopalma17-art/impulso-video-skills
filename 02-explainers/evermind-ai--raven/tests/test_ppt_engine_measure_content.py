"""Whether a page shows anything, and how wide a table gets.

There used to be a character ceiling here as well. It was one number for every
language, and a character is not one thing: measured in one box at one size,
Chinese fills it at 400 and English at 1168, so 700 fired long after a Chinese
page had overflowed and never at all on an English one. What it was for is done
by measuring the render -- `card_overflow`, `clipped_copy`, `crowded_panel` --
which is a fact about the built page rather than a count standing in for one.
