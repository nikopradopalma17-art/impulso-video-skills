"""Claims about actions, checked against the actions that happened.

The case these exist for: a loop read "you are right, cancel it", wrote "the
owner confirmed the issue and authorized cancellation" into its conclusion, and
never called cancel. Judged on its text it passed.

Two layers, and the split matters. A structured claim the log does not back is
refused, because accepting it hands a misleading report to whoever acts next. A
prose assertion the log does not back is only flagged, because prose is for
people and a heuristic that refuses reports over phrasing would be measuring
itself.
