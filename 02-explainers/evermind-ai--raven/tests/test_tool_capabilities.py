A second description of an existing rule is only worth having while it stays
true. These drive a real ``AgentLoop`` and compare what it offers the model
against what the table predicts, for every combination that changes an answer --
so the table cannot quietly become a third opinion about which tools are
available. Registration stopped being the gate: every gated tool is registered
now and *withheld* while unconfigured, so the predicate a deployer feels is
``offers_by_name``, never ``has``.
