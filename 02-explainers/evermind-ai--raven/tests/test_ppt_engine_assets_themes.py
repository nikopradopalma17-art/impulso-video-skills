"""What a palette has to be true of before a deck is allowed to use it.

Two families of assertion live here. The presets are checked as data -- ten of
them, every page white, every text contrast cleared -- because they were
verified by hand once and this is what stops a later edit undoing that quietly.
The derived themes are checked as a function over random seeds, because there is
no hand review at all on a palette the model invents at runtime: the guarantee
has to hold for every seed or it holds for none.
