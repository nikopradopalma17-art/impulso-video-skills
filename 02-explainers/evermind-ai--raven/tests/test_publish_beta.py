"""Publish-boundary gate for the beta wheel.

``_verify_wheel`` is the last thing between a mis-built wheel and the channel
testers install from. Each check exists for an artifact that degrades quietly:
a missing bundle or page still installs and still starts, a missing sub-agent
tree just reports an empty installation, and a leaked secrets file is invisible
until someone unzips the wheel.
