"""Channel config declarations (config-with-cargo, every adapter).

Every spec declares the cargo slice of its channel's config in the same
vocabulary plugin manifests use, and since the central per-channel classes
retired (M2), the declaration is the only truth: defaults, secrecy,
requiredness, choices and nesting all live here. This guard keeps the
declarations complete and the dispensing honest -- there is no second
source left to drift against, so what it pins now is the door's own
contract.
