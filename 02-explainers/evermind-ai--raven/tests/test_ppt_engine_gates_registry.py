    number -- the one state `unnumbered_pages` is about and one no deck tripping
    `no_footer` can be in -- and puts a row of panels over a row of copy on a second
    grid, which is the one state `grid_drift` is about; the seventh divides its body
    with nothing, which every other fixture here does with a panel or a picture; and the
    eighth sits on a layout that carries the template's photograph, which is on no page

    Seven kinds, in three groups. Provenance: a page crediting a figure it does not
    show. What was agreed with the user -- its length, its language, and two ways of
    not building inside the template it was given: pages still carrying the
    template's own placeholder copy, and pages that cloned a template page for its
    background and laid new text boxes over it. A deck that ships "click here to add
    a title" is not the deck the user asked for. And the measurements: copy painted
    over copy in the render, and type a reader cannot make out against the ground it
    landed on -- #1A1A1A on #000000 is not a matter of degree.

    Two kinds left this set (D3b). `page_mapping` protects the ability to match a
    render back to the code that drew it, which is not something a reader sees. `prototype_kept`
    compares a page against a promise the outline made about it, and one run drew a
    better page than the promise -- refusing it asked for a worse one.

    A third left it (D17): `band`. It was the one matter of taste that refused a
    deck, held there by "prose demonstrably could not stop it", and three misfires
    took the demonstrably away -- bar series read as accent strips, planes carrying
    copy read as empty bands, and a template's own kicker rule refused by an eighth
    of a millimetre. Each was patched with another exemption, and two runs lost a whole
    stage to a band finding that was itself wrong. It still reports.

    That last one is the deliberate exception to D2, added after three live runs
    delivered decks with overlapping text: the rest of the measured layout problems
    are satisfiable by shrinking the copy, so refusing on them could be answered by
    making the page worse -- but the type floor is measured too, so shrinking out of
    a collision only trades one finding for another, and the move a collision
    actually wants is a wider box, which costs the page nothing.

    agreed between them rather than with the measurements. A page whose outline names
    a table and whose file holds none is not a page that is nearly right, nothing
    about it is answered by making the page smaller, and both ways out are one edit
    -- the same argument that already makes `unplaced_figure` fatal on every route.

    Three more left the set (D52), and for one reason rather than three: none of them
    had been measured against work it was wrong about. `boxless_copy` was calibrated
    over 531 pages for a single finding, and that page's box was moved by the author
    program's own safe-area constants. `literal_escape` fired zero times over the
    seven runs D3b read one by one, and both pages it was written from were found by
    a person rather than by the check. `house_style` has never been recorded firing
    at all, and the one test for its ordinary case compared a deck against itself.
    Each still reports, which is the half of them that stands on evidence.
