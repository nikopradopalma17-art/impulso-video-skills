"""Every AgentLoop construction site must hand over the capabilities it owns.

``TokenWiseConfig.enabled``, ``.cache_optimization`` and ``.max_cache_breakpoints``
all defaulted to working values, ``CacheOptimizer`` was complete and benchmarked,
and ``install_from_config`` -- the one function that turns those flags into a
registry -- had no callers. Nothing passed ``strategies=`` to ``AgentLoop``, so
every surface ran the empty pass-through registry and the strategy never
executed once.

The default value was correct, so a test over defaults, a schema assertion or a
config validator cannot catch this: it was a reachability failure, not a
configuration one. The only thing that catches the class is enumerating the
construction sites and requiring each to either wire the capability or say in
writing why it does not.

That is what this file does. It is deliberately source-level, because the
failure mode is the absence of an argument -- which produces no runtime signal
anywhere.
