"""Which metric a campaign is read by, when nobody named one.

This tool layer is shared with every domain that runs jobs, so it must not know
any metric by name. It used to default to "ndcg" in five places, which is how a
CFD campaign came to read back "trials succeeded but none reported metric 'ndcg'"
for runs that reported their residual perfectly well.

Removing the default cannot mean rewriting the campaigns that predate the
``objective`` field: r13 and r14 are on disk, and editing their meta to suit
today's code would edit the record of what the device was while they ran. What
their records themselves report is a fact rather than a guess, so that is the
last resort -- and only when it settles the question outright.
