"""Tests for raven.providers.reasoning -- recovering an orphaned </think>.

A backend run without a reasoning parser swallows the opening tag into its
prompt template, so the completion carries bare reasoning prose followed by a
lone closing tag and no opener to pair it with. ``split_orphan_think`` is the
one place that shape gets recognized and split; a paired block or no tag at
all must pass through untouched for the existing complete-block handlers.
