"""What the coverage rows claim when a render is missing, and when one is unusable.

Two questions live behind "no PDF came back", and they take opposite remedies: a
machine with no LibreOffice wants one installed, and a deck that did not come out
of a LibreOffice that is right there does not. Sending the second author at the
first remedy is the failure these tests pin.

And the case after that: a PDF came back, a page image came back with it, and the
image is blank or the wrong size. Every measurement that reads pixels then finds
nothing to complain about and the page is reported clean, which is the one thing it
demonstrably is not.

The page's recorded size is read off a PDF written by hand here rather than off a
converted deck, so the whole set runs on a machine with no LibreOffice; only a PDF
reader is needed, and both of the two read this file.
