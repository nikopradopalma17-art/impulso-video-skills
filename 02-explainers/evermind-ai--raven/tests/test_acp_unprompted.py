"""The recorder for what an ACP agent does between prompts.

Every sink in `_SessionRouter` is attached for one run and detached at its end,
which reads the stream as request/response. An on-call agent breaks that: it
wakes on its own schedule, works, and reports with nobody having asked. These
pin the two outputs that make such a turn exist for the operator -- the wire
events a pane renders live, and the instance-log row a fresh entry reads back --
because each shipped broken while the other looked finished.
