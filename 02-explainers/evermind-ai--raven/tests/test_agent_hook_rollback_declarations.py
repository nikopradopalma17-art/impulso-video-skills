"""A tree whose hook can roll back declares it on the class the loop sees.

``AgentHook.rolls_back_iterations`` is read off the hook object the loop holds,
once per turn, before any per-session state is resolved. A hook that delegates
its phases to a per-session chain therefore cannot have the flag derived for it:
the chain does not exist yet at the moment of the read. ``ResearchFlowHook`` is
that shape -- its six rollback sites live in ``gates/``, behind a composite it
builds per session -- so the declaration is the only thing standing between a
rolled-back draft and the reader, and nothing local to ``flow.py`` hints that it
is needed. This file is that hint.

The producing set is derived rather than listed: every ``HookDecision`` built
with ``rollback=True`` is found by AST, so a tree that grows a rollback has to
appear in ``REGISTERED_HOOK`` before this file passes. AST rather than imports on
purpose -- ``raven_design`` and ``raven_ppt`` are editable installs rooted at the
main checkout, so importing them from a worktree reads the main checkout's code
instead of the revision under test.
