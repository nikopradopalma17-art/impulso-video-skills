"""Dependabot's commit prefixes stay inside the scope enum that lints them.

Two files have to agree and neither imports the other: `.github/dependabot.yml`
decides what a dependency-bump commit is called, and `commitlint.config.cjs`
decides which names are legal. They drifted apart once already. A
`chore(deps-dev)` bump merged on 2026-06-30 (#24); the scope enum became
enforced on 2026-09-05 carrying a literal `deps` and no sibling; from then on
every dependabot dev-dependency pull request failed a gate for using a scope
the repo had already accepted, and nothing caught it until a person read a CI
log months later.

The other half is coverage. dependabot.yml only configures the trees listed in
it, while security updates reach every manifest through the dependency graph --
so a tree missing from this file still gets pull requests, just with none of
the labels, grouping or commit-message settings. Two npm trees had been in that
state since they were created.

Both directions are pinned here: every scope the config will emit is legal,
scopes it will never emit are still rejected (an enum that accepted everything
would satisfy the first assertion), and every lockfile in the tree is
configured.
