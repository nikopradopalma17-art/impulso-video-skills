"""Tests for the case read/edit tools.

These tools shipped with no tests at all. The gap surfaced when a real round
showed why the trial requirement mattered: a campaign has no trials until
something is submitted, so an agent that wanted to look at the case it was about
to run had no sanctioned way to do it, went out over raw ssh, timed out on the
default port, and submitted the job anyway.

So the reads here are: a trial's case still works; the campaign's staged case
works with no trial; and neither path lets a caller out of the case directory.
