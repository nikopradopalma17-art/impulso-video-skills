"""The exec tool's background lane: harness custody for long local commands.

What separates this from ``nohup`` in the command string is everything the
tests below pin: the task has a handle, the log has a managed path the result
names, the child is tracked and reapable, and the lane changes none of the
rules -- the permission gate (which rules on the call before either lane is
chosen) and the sandbox boundary still have the last word.
