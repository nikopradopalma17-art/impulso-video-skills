"""The MCP servers a session brings to raven-as-a-sub-agent.

Raven used to refuse ``mcpServers`` outright, which made it the one ACP agent of
the four that could not be handed a server -- and the refusal's stated reason was
half right: MCP is connected once per process, and nothing scoped a server to one
session. The second half is what these pin down.

What arrives is not a server definition in any interesting sense: it is a stdio
stanza pointing at an endpoint the dispatcher opened, holding no credentials, and
the socket's mode is the whole of the boundary. So the tests here are about the
two things raven still owns -- connecting what it was handed, and making it
reachable from that session's turns and nowhere else -- plus the reclaim, because
a connection nothing closes is a subprocess nothing kills.
