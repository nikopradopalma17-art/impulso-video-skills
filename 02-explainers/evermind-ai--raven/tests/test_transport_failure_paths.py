"""An upstream failure is not an answer, on either response path.

The upstream can mark a call failed in the response body -- `finish_reason=error`
with nothing in it -- and the client library rewrites that to `stop` from a
lookup table, silently and in place (litellm 1.97.0,
`core_helpers.py` maps `"error": "stop"`; `gpt_transformation.py` overwrites
the field and keeps no copy). Raven's retry ladder gates on
`finish_reason != "error"`, so it judged the call healthy: no retry, no
classification, no model fallback. A backend blip that one retry would have
healed became a hard failure, and the error pointed at the model.

Where the response was assembled through `Choices.__init__` the library keeps
the value it renamed, so the upstream's own word is readable and these pin that
reading; where a vendor overwrote the reason on an already-built choice nothing
was kept, and they pin the decision made from local evidence instead. Both paths
ask the same question, for the reason
`truncation.py` gives for asking its own on both: a verdict reached on one
and not the other means the same fault reads differently in the TUI than
outside it.
