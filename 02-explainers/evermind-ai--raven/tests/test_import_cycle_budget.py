"""The import cycles among raven's top-level subpackages may not grow.

`acyclic_siblings` is the import-linter contract that would forbid cycles
outright. It is not in pyproject.toml because it is BROKEN: 18 of the 40
top-level subpackages sit in one strongly connected component. Added as a gate
it would paint CI red on arrival and be switched off within the week.

So the same rule is stated as a budget. The three ceilings are what the tree
measures and may only go down: unpicking a cycle lowers one, which is a reviewed
edit to this file rather than a drive-by.

What the ceilings do and do not catch
-------------------------------------
They are aggregate counts, so they catch an edge that draws something NEW into a
cycle -- a package or module that was outside one, or a pair that did not import
each other. They do NOT catch an edge added between two members of the existing
component: everything there is already counted, so every total stays put. That
case is left to the contracts and to review; this file is a ratchet on breadth,
not a proof that no cycle was deepened.

Why three numbers
-----------------
Mutual pairs are the edges people add, and the failure message names them. A
cycle three packages long shows up in no pair, so a component measure carries
the general case. And the package measure is an artifact of granularity as much
as of design: collapsing a package to one node turns "config's writer reaches
agent, which reaches config's loader" into a cycle even where no module imports
itself back, so the module measure answers the different question of whether a
reader has a real knot to walk around. The two move independently -- the
vocabulary split below took the package count from 22 to 18 while moving the
module count by three.

All three read the graph import-linter itself is checked against, built with the
`exclude_type_checking_imports` setting from `[tool.importlinter]`. Measuring
without it counts imports that only exist for a type checker, which puts
`gateway` in a cycle it does not have at runtime.

# 2026-09-11 upstream sync landed two pairs of modules that import each other,
# and deferring an import does not help -- this graph counts a function-local
# import exactly like a top-level one. The trajectory pair was unpicked here by
# moving the two shared exception types into a leaf module
# (raven/trajectory/errors.py), which is what took the count 46 -> 44. The CLI
# pair (cli.trajectory_browse with cli.trajectory_commands) needs about 94
# lines of code that arrived in the same sync moved to a third module, and is
# left to a follow-up; those two modules are the whole of the raise from 42.

    far as this repository is concerned. Building without the option counts those
    edges and measures a graph no contract enforces: it puts ``gateway`` in a
