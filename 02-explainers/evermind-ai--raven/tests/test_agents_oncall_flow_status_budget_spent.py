"""The budget line states what is left, not only what was allowed.

Measured 2026-08-12 on the OpenFOAM leg, and it cost the run. The status output
said only:

    Campaign compute budget: 150 core-minute in total.

No spend, no remainder -- while the backend could answer both (``spent_minutes``
read 16.65 off the box at that moment). So the loop derived the spend itself, from
ExecutionTime in the solver log, and multiplied by a core count it had passed in
its own config and that the job script silently ignores. It concluded 70.9
core-minutes were gone with 79.1 left, against a true 17.7 and 132.3, and on that
4x overestimate it cut ``endTime`` from 1 to 0.5 -- reducing the objective the
task had set, in a budget that would have covered the original.

Its arithmetic was right on its own premises. The premise was missing from the
only place that could supply it.

This is the mirror image of the usual gate here. Most refusals exist because we
can CHECK a thing the loop must supply. This one is a number we can SUPPLY and
were not supplying.
