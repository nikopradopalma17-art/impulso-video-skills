"""A turn's parts carry how long they took, from the stream to a restored view.

How long the model thought and how long each tool ran were measured only in the
browser that watched the stream, so switching sessions or reloading the page
threw both numbers away -- the restored transcript had to either show nothing or
invent a clock that started at page load. These tests pin the two spans as
stored properties of the entries they belong to, and pin that an entry written
before they existed reads as *unknown* rather than as zero.
