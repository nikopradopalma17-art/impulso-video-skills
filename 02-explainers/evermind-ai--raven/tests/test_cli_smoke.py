"""Smoke tests covering every CLI command surface.

This file's job is to catch *crash-class* regressions (``NameError`` /
``AttributeError`` / ``ImportError``) that slip through the more focused
per-command tests. It walks every top-level command + every subcommand
group's ``--help`` and asserts:

1. exit code 0
2. no ``Traceback`` printed
3. ``r.exception`` is None (typer.testing.CliRunner captures crashes here)

It also catches the historical regression where ``agent_commands.py`` was
missing the ``sync_workspace_templates`` import after the CLI modularize
refactor — that bug would have been caught here.
