"""The regenerator's refusals, which are what keep the shipped pin true.

The icon data is the one third-party import a reader cannot check by eye: 1304
glyphs converted out of five thousand SVGs, and the only thing standing between
that and a fabrication is the pin in the file header. A pin is worth exactly what
happens when somebody regenerates -- if the script writes whatever it is handed,
the first rerun turns a fact back into a claim without anyone noticing, which is
the state the header was in when it carried a bare version string and nothing else.

So the refusals are the subject here, not the conversion: the conversion is
exercised by every icon in `test_assets_icons`, and it is only trustworthy because
these hold.
