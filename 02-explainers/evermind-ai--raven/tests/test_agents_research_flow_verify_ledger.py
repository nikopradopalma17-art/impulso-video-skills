"""The verify gate's counters must leave the process.

`rejected_on_elided` was cited as "identically zero across the whole tree" in the
evidence that retracted the dr@2.x elision attribution. It was not zero: the warning
emitted alongside its increment is present on 8-12.5% of the questions in every DR arm
of six separate batches. It read as zero because nothing ever wrote it down - the
counter lived in per-turn metadata and died with the subprocess, and the only trace was
a logger line in a stderr tail the launcher truncates to 1500 bytes.

So these tests pin the three properties that make the record trustworthy rather than
merely present:

* an absent ledger writes nothing at all (write-only, off by default);
* a gate that was installed but never fired is distinguishable from a gate that was
  never installed, because the second one cannot produce the `installed` line;
* an outcome that measured nothing writes null, never 0.
