"""The request, read literally and handed back before the answer is written.

The 2026-09-04 head-to-head lost three dimensions to constraints that were stated in the
request and satisfied by intention rather than by checking: a named section was absent, five
candidates outside the stated envelope took slots in the main table, and the do-not-bother
list carried items the request had already ruled out.

Every test here is written from the failure direction that matters. A checklist that misses
a constraint costs nothing - the reminder is what it always was. A checklist that invents
one, or quotes half a name, tells the model about a requirement the reader never wrote, and
there is no gate downstream that can tell the difference. So the extractors are pinned on
what they refuse as much as on what they read.
