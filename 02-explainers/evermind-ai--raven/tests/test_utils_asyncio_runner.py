"""The bounded replacement for ``asyncio.run`` at the shutdown-bearing entry points.

Driven as a subprocess, deliberately: the defect is in the runner's own
teardown, which only happens when a runner owns the loop. A test that awaited
the stubborn task inside pytest's loop would report success against a shape
production never takes -- that is precisely the hole this file exists to close.
