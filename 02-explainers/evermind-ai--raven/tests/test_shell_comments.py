"""A comment is text the shell will not run, and must not decide safety.

The policy turns `#` off in its lexer, so an English comment keeps taking part
in quote parsing. Three read-only commands were refused in one session because
their comments said `there's`, `what's` and `raven's`: the apostrophe opened a
quote that never closed, `shlex` raised, and the fail-closed branch answered
`hard_deny`. The user could only see "policy evaluation failed", asked four
times why, and the model -- given nothing to go on -- guessed wrong twice.

Fail-closed is right and stays: an executable region nobody can parse is still
refused. What changes is that the region the shell would ignore stops being
read as if it would run.

Both gates are tested here, but they no longer answer the same question. The
deny list has one owner now; what `ExecTool._guard_command` still decides on
its own is the allowlist and the workspace boundary. A comment could reach
both -- so those are what it is asked about here, rather than a second deny
read that no longer exists.
