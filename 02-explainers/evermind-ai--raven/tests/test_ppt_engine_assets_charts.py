"""The fifteen charts, drawn and then read back off the slide.

`ppt_charts` is generated source: it reaches the author as a file in the build
directory, so the only test worth writing installs it, imports it and draws with
it. A test that compared strings would pass for a module with a NameError in it
and the author would meet the error in a failed build, attributed to its own
program.

What is asserted is what a chart can be wrong about and a render cannot show. A
bar out of proportion to its value looks like a bar; a scale that quietly starts
above zero looks like a chart; two labels a tenth of an inch apart look fine at
review size and are unreadable in the room. Those are measured here. So is the
one class of defect this route has shipped before -- geometry escaping the region
it was given -- because a chart that overflows its box lands on whatever the page
put beside it.
