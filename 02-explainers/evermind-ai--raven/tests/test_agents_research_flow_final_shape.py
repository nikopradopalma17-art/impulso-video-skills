The tests that matter here are the negative ones. A shaper that only ever
improves things is easy to write and easy to break later; what has to be pinned
is that it *cannot* blank or shorten a record, because that is the failure class
it was built against (an upstream extraction stage carried gold on 71/120 into a
boxed field on 58/120 - net zero produced, 10.83pp dropped).

So every positive case below is paired with the corresponding refusal, and the
class defaults are asserted directly: the anchor arms run this same code path,
so a default flip would move the reference frame without any test failing.
