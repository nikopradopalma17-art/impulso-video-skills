"""Whose credentials the routing gate's readiness probe reads.

``_routed_target_ready`` answers for the lane a route points at, not for the
host loop that asks. The two are separately configured: a product is rendered
from its own folder first (``agents/<product>/.env``) and inherits the host's
sections only where the folder is silent, so a probe wired to the host's own
readers is wrong in both directions -- it refuses a lane equipped by its own
file on a host that holds nothing, and it opens a lane whose pipeline has no
key for the surface it actually calls.

The declaration side of the same gate -- which routes are probed at all -- is
in ``test_subagent_routing_backend.py``; this file is only about what the probe
measures once a route has asked for it.
