"""A config with no entries still needs a name.

Measured 2026-08-12 on the OpenFOAM leg. The loop edited the case on the box, so
by submit time it had no parameters left to pass and sent ``configs=[{}]``. That
is a legitimate round -- the change was already in the case -- but the key built
from it was the empty string, and the empty string is not a name:

  * ``jobs/{idem_key}`` collapsed from ``jobs/<trial>/`` to ``jobs/`` itself, so
    the case, the pid file and the log landed in the jobs root;
  * the ledger record was filed under ``""``;
  * the backend handle read ``ops-``.

Only one job ran, so nothing showed. A second empty-config job would have reused
the same directory and the same ledger key and overwritten the first, silently.

The fix keeps idempotency intact rather than making each empty config unique:
two empty configs ARE the same config, and an idempotency key that agreed on
that was never the problem. The problem is that it agreed on a name that no path
and no ledger can hold.
