"""The render chain, end to end and at its edges.

The chain is the deck's only mirror: what the author looks at, what the design
pass judges, and the surface every rendered-page measurement is taken off. It is
also the part of the capability made almost entirely of other people's software --
LibreOffice, PDFium, poppler, Pillow -- so what is worth testing is not the code's
branches but its agreements with them: that the coordinates come back in the units
and the orientation the contract promises, that the fallback backend reads the same
page as the preferred one, and that two conversions at once both produce a file.

Prerequisites, and what is skipped without them:

    libreoffice   pptx -> pdf. Without it, everything downstream of a real deck
                  skips; the parsers and the segmenter still run.
    pypdfium2     preferred reader. Absent, poppler covers it.
    poppler-utils pdftoppm / pdftotext, the fallback. Absent, its parity test skips.
