"""Per-turn shadow-git checkpoint + max-iter interrupted handling.

Covers the runtime-discipline safety net gated by

- CheckpointService snapshots the worktree without touching the user's .git.
- A max-iteration turn reports ``status="interrupted"`` (not a fake

- With policy="never" (or "interactive" + interactive=False), the loop is
