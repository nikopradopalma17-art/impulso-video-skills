"""Trigger vocabulary: offline expansion, its guards, the index, and retrieval.

The LLM gate this file used to cover is gone. It judged one message with no
conversation history and, on a hit, dispatched a whole graph before the model
ran -- see :mod:`raven.playbook.matcher` for why that moved. Keywords now decide
which playbooks get *described* to the model when the library is too big to list
whole, which is what the router tests at the bottom cover.
