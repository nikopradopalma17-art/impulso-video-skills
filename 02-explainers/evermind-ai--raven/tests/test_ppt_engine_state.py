"""A figure's two captions, as the reader of a deck's state is shown them.

`caption` is what the figure's own source printed under it; `visual_caption` is a
sentence a model wrote by looking at the pixels. `Figure.summary` used to render
`caption or visual_caption`, so the second arrived in a prompt, and in the citation
reasoning downstream, indistinguishable from the first.

The case these are built from is real. A marketing banner reading "OPEN SKILLS FOR
REAL AGENTS / Curate the ecosystem. Retrieve what matters. / 821K -> 96,401 open
skills, curated" was inspected, captioned as the architecture of a system, and the
built page then credited the picture to a product.
