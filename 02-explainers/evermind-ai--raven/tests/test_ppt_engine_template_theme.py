"""Which two faces a bound template hands the author, and which of its colours.

The face defects both showed on the same Chinese template, whose scheme names
`('Arial', '微软雅黑')`: the Latin face came back as the Han one, and the CJK key
the authoring documents all tell an author to read was not in the theme at all.

The colour half is about the scheme's "second pair". `bg2` and `tx2` are where a
template states a second plane and a second ink, and `theme_of` used to mix both
from the first pair instead, so the plane the author was handed was not the one the
template draws with -- across five 20-page decks built inside the bundled
`5407617`, the `#F0F0F0` its `bg2` states was the dominant plane on two of them,
45% and 78% of all fill area. The stated colour is preferred now, and what
decides is a comparison against the palette rather than a threshold: these tests
are the four ways a stated colour loses that comparison, plus the ten bundled
templates measured end to end.
