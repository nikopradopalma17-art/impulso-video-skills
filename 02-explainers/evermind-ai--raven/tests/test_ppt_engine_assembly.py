"""What gets registered, and the failure the predecessor could not see.

Its assembly function carried ten branches on one boolean, two of which
contradicted each other: a sub-route was registered under
`expert_outline and not free_composition` while `expert_outline` already implied
`free_composition`. Fifteen hundred lines of tooling were unreachable under every
configuration for months, and a test had frozen that as the expected behaviour.

The lesson is not "check that predicate". It is that assembly must verify its own
result against the route's declaration instead of trusting the arithmetic that
produced it.
