"""The workspace fence must read the command the shell will run, not the one typed.

``restrict_to_workspace`` is an operator's promise that the agent cannot reach
outside its workspace. It kept that promise only for paths spelled literally.
``_extract_absolute_paths`` wants a ``/`` sitting on a word boundary, and
``$HOME/`` puts ``E`` there, so a variable spelling produced no candidate at
all -- and ``os.path.expandvars`` sat downstream of the extraction it needed to
feed, so it never saw the text that hid the path. ``cat /etc/shadow`` was
refused while ``cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`` ran.

An unset name is the sharpest form: the shell drops it, so ``$NOPE/etc/shadow``
*is* ``/etc/shadow``, and the fence was reading a ``/`` glued to a letter.

What made it worth fixing rather than noting is that nothing else was looking.
``cat`` is read-only, so the permission gate tiers it ``allow`` and asks nobody;
for a read the fence was the only thing in the way.

Stepping out is the same escape as reaching out, and the last section is the
destinations no pattern can take: ``cd /`` has nothing after the slash, ``..``
is not absolute, and a ``cd`` with no argument names ``$HOME`` by saying
nothing. ``cd /etc`` is not among them -- that is a path, and always was.

The rest of the file is the over-blocking these tests exist to stop. The fence
has to expand the way the shell does -- the environment the child is actually
given, ``$PWD`` as the directory it runs in, nothing at all inside single
quotes -- or a workspace-relative command starts getting refused and the
operator turns the fence off, which costs more than the hole did.
