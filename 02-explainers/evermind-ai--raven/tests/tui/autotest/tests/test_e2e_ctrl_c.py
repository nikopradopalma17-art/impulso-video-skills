"""E2E Ctrl+C hardening.

Ctrl+C is a ladder in `ui-tui/src/app/useInputHandlers.ts`, not an exit key:
a busy UI cancels the turn, a non-empty composer clears the input, and only an
idle UI with an empty composer quits. These pin the two rungs reachable without
spending a turn, and each asserts the intermediate state rather than only the
final exit code -- pressing twice and checking just the exit passes even when
the first press did nothing.

The third rung -- Ctrl+C while a turn is in flight -- is covered a layer down
rather than here, since provoking it needs a live turn: `decideCtrlC` in
ui-tui/src/__tests__/useInputHandlers.test.ts pins which rung a keypress lands
on, chatStream / turn-subscribe cover the client side of the cancel, and
tests/integration/test_tui_cancel_inflight_e2e.py drives turn.cancel over a real
RpcServer with a fake streaming agent. What no test does is the physical
end-to-end; the chat e2e presses Ctrl+C only after the status bar returns to
ready, so it exercises this same quit path.
