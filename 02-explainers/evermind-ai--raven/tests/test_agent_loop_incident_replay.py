"""Replay of the 2026-09-01 dispatched-run incident, end to end.

Two defects, one 28-minute hang. Both are replayed against the real
``LiteLLMProvider`` built from the deployed raven-code config's shape
(OpenRouter as the ``custom`` provider, ``anthropic/claude-opus-5``,
``reasoningEffort: high``, ``maxTokens: 32768``, ``llmCallTimeout: 1800``),
over the ACP path -- the streaming call -- with ``acompletion`` faked to behave
the way the gateway did:

1. A thinking-only response: reasoning fills the output, no body, no tool
   call. The recovery used to answer with PREFILL, re-feeding that reasoning as
   a trailing assistant message. Anthropic refuses such a request while
   thinking is on, and OpenRouter returned neither an error nor a byte, so the
   turn hung to the request budget. The fake gateway does the same: a request
   that ends on an assistant message opens a stream that never yields.
2. The stream's only stall detector was the whole request budget (1800s), so
   that hang cost half an hour instead of minutes.

The fake ends the reasoning with a plain ``stop``, which is how the incident's
response reached the classifier: the thinking-only path is the one under test,
not any handling of a truncated output.

Timeouts are scaled down (seconds for the incident's half hours); the ratios
and the outcomes are what matter. Written to run unchanged against a tree that
predates the fixes, where the first replay hangs for the scaled budget and ends
the turn on an error, and the second replay's stall lasts the whole budget.
