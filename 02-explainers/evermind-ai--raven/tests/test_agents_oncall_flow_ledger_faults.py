"""Fault injection on the ledger: what survives a crash, and what does not.

The ledger's whole purpose is to be readable after the process dies, so its
failure modes are worth testing directly rather than inferring from the write
path. Three faults are injected here, in order of how bad they are for a
resident on-call process:

  - killed mid-write -- the temp-file-plus-rename pattern should make this a
    non-event, and it does;
  - a leftover temp file from that kill -- must never be mistaken for the
    ledger;
  - a torn or empty ledger -- possible when the host loses power rather than
    the process being killed, because the rename is atomic but the contents are
    never fsynced. This is the one that stops the loop from starting at all.

A loop that refuses to start is worse than a loop with a stale ledger: nobody
is watching and nothing says so.
