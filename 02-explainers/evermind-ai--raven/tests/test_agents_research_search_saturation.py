"""The saturation rule must be provable from its own output, not inferred.

Its predecessor is the reason this file is long. dr@2.8's cross-query dedup shipped
with a counter named for the mechanism, ``dedup_skipped``, and that counter reads 0
on every search row of every batch since - 13,198 and 10,615 rows on one batch
alone. So there is no on-disk evidence the mechanism ever fired, and whether it did
has to be argued from an unrelated field. Two separate causes produced that: the
knob was never switched on in any arm's config, AND the counting branch is
unreachable on the live-web path anyway because the result pool is never deeper
than the rendered width. Neither cause is visible in a 0.

The tests below therefore assert three different things, and the third is the one
that class of defect needs:

1. that the rule fires when it should (ordinary correctness),
2. that it does NOT fire when it should not (no over-triggering),
3. that its ledger payload distinguishes "did not fire" from "was not installed",
   and reports what the rule DID rather than what it was configured to do.
