"""The three research modes are three stop rules, not three sizes of one budget.

Until 2026-09-07 every knob that differed between ``medium`` and ``high`` was a
permission -- a ceiling, a gate threshold, a timeout -- and a 5-question x
3-mode batch on deepseek-v4-flash-0731 found the two arms statistically
indistinguishable: iterations 6.6 vs 7.4, searches 5.6 vs 6.0, wall clock 51.9
vs 50.6 minutes, every paired difference inside the within-arm spread and half
of them the wrong sign. The cause is structural rather than numeric. What ends a
turn is the model deciding it has enough, and a ceiling the turn never
approaches cannot move that decision: the arms used 3-11 of the 20 and 30
iterations they were allowed.

So each mode now owns a different terminator, and these tests hold that shape:

* ``medium`` keeps the sufficiency release -- an independent judge may end the
  turn as soon as the retrieved pages decide the question;
* ``high`` and ``max`` drop that door entirely and terminate on the reviewer
  instead, which is why their reject -> revise path may run more than once and
  why a rejection buys a deeper retrieval round;
* ``max`` additionally demands an evidence floor before any draft ships, so a
  draft on too few readable pages or too few sites goes back to research.

``medium`` and ``high`` also share a door BEFORE research: the plain-first gate
withholds the web tools for the first model call and lets a judged answer to a
settled question ship without a round. How a turn ENDS is what the tiers rank, and
a settled question should not get slower for choosing high. ``max`` is the survey
tier, chosen so no source is missed, so its overlay turns the door off -- and its
rollback budget sits exactly on the loop cap, with no room for that bounce anyway.

The first version of this redesign gave max the retrieval ladder and a wider
evidence round instead, and a second batch found high and max INVERTED: both
levers need a trigger (a dry search streak, a reviewer's rejection) and neither
arrived in fifteen turns, so the two modes ran the same flow under two labels.
Hence the last rule below: what separates two modes has to be a gate consulted on
every draft, not one that waits on an event the turn may never produce.

The guard tests are the ones that would have caught both collapses: a mode has to
name a knob that changes which gate ends its turn, the retired overlay is kept
here as the counter-example that guard has to reject, and adjacent modes have to
differ on an unconditional terminator.
