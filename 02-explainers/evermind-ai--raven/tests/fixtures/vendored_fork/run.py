"""Host-side launcher for the Raven-X deep-research agent's ACP server.

The host raven spawns this once per connection and speaks ACP on its
stdin/stdout; one process serves every conversation, and turns, sessions and
answers are all protocol business handled inside Raven-X. What remains of the
old per-turn launcher is the one job that cannot move into either side's
config: merging the `.env` secrets into a config file Raven-X can load.
`config.json` ships without them, and Raven-X's loader does no environment
substitution, so a rendered copy is the only way to get them in.

The rendered copy lands under STATE_ROOT, and the location is load-bearing:
Raven-X derives its runtime data dir from the config file's own parent, so
transcripts, cache and logs follow the rendered file out of this folder. The
workspace is pinned under the same root too - the schema's default is
`~/.raven/workspace`, the host raven's own, which this agent must not share.

After rendering, this process *execs* the checkout's own `raven acp`: the
server inherits this pid, process group and stdio, so the host's
process-group kill reaches it and nothing sits between the client and the
frames. The host tears the group down with SIGKILL, so no cleanup here could
ever run at shutdown; leftover rendered configs are swept by pid-liveness on
the next launch instead. stdout belongs to the protocol - every diagnostic
line goes to stderr, which the host journals.
