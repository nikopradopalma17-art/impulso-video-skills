"""How much copy a template's box holds, said before the deck is built.

The reactive half reports a box that could not show its copy at the end of the
program. This is the same measurement on the template's own boxes, in the roster
reply, where the author is still deciding what to write into them -- so the tests
here are about what the band says, which boxes it refuses to speak for, and that it
never contradicts the copy the template's own designer put in the box.
