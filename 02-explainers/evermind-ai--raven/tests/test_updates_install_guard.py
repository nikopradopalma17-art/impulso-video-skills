"""Detecting an environment an upgrade has not finished writing.

The case these guard: `system.upgrade` makes serve exit, a supervisor respawns
it, and the respawn lands between uv deleting the old environment and writing
the new one. Nothing downstream can recover from that on its own -- the page
route is chosen once -- so the detection here is the whole of the fix.
