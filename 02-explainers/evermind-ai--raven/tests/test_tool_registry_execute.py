"""Tests for the ToolRegistry execute boundary (raven/agent/tools/registry.py).

``Tool.execute`` may return ``str`` or :class:`ToolResult`, but every consumer
of the registry other than the agent loop -- the sentinel action executor, the
subagent manager, the context curator, tracing -- treats the return value as
model text and puts it straight into a message, a reply or an artifact. So the
registry unwraps here and hands back a ``str`` with the display string attached.
