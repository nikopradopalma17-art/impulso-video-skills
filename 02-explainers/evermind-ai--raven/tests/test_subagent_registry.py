"""Name resolution across the agent table.

The generic built-in row was renamed ``raven`` -> ``Raven``, and the names written
into instance-registry rows, direct-chat records and stored dag nodes before that
were not rewritten. Every one of those references still has to resolve, which is
what :data:`LEGACY_AGENT_ALIASES` is for -- and it has to resolve *without* the
roster ever offering the old spelling back to the model, or the table would
advertise two names for one agent.
