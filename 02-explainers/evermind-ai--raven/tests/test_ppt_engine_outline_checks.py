"""What the outline stage measures about the plan itself.

Both checks here were written against a real twelve-page plan and only after it was
read: three of its pages were section dividers announcing the claim of the page
behind them, and none of its twelve pages planned to show a figure while the
materials held thirteen.

The table-plan half at the end comes from a different source -- the column-squeeze
measurement the built deck is already held to -- and its last case draws the two
plans it disagrees about and measures them, so the derivation is run rather than
argued.
