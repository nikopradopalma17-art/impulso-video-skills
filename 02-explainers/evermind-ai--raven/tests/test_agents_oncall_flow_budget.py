"""What a campaign may spend, and how concurrent use adds up.

The unit is the campaign's to declare and this layer never interprets it. It used
to price everything in GPU minutes, so a CFD campaign inherited a field named
budget_minutes_total whose value meant core-minutes -- one name, two quantities,
indistinguishable to every reader including the loop.

The accumulation rule is declared for the same reason it exists: it follows the
unit, not the backend. Occupancy of one device counts an overlap once; work done
on cores counts every core. Putting that in each backend would mean a new
accumulator per platform, when what differs is one word.
