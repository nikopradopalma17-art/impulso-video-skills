"""The preset catalogue as a data file: it loads, it is complete, and it evaluates.

The route could draw two rectangles before this existed, so every process page was
a row of boxes and the arrows were whitespace. What makes the fix real is not that
`MSO_SHAPE` has 177 members -- python-pptx always had those -- but that something
can answer *where the point lands*, and python-pptx cannot: it carries the names
and the default `avLst` and no `gdLst` or `pathLst` at all. The guide formulas are
here, so the questions worth testing are whether the packaged copy is the whole
standard table, whether every one of them evaluates, and whether the numbers that
come out are the numbers Office draws.

The lookup half is the same argument the icon set already paid for: an author on
the script route gets no schema enum, so a name that misses has to answer with
what was probably meant rather than with "no".
