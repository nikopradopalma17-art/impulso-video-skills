"""`raven serve` -- locating the page it serves.

Two independent pieces of the repo have to agree on one path for a released
raven to answer with the real page: the wheel build hook copies ``ui-web/dist`` to
``raven/ui/dist``, and ``resolve_ui_dist`` looks for it there. Nothing failed
loudly when they disagreed -- the gateway came up, the WebSocket worked, and
``/`` answered with the "No front end built here" placeholder, which is
indistinguishable from a developer who simply never ran the build.
