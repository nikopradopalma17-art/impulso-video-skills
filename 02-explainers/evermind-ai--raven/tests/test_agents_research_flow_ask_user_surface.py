"""dr@3.4-askuser: the surface the clarify round is read and called through.

The third file of the fork's ``test_agent_flow_ask_user.py`` split, and the one
its two siblings deliberately do not carry: the prompt bytes the feature was
measured on, the identity rewrite the on state applies to them, the
``delivery="tool"`` restatement of the clause, and the registry-facing facts
about the tool object. ``AskUserGate`` and ``ClarifyExemptHook`` are driven from
``test_agents_research_flow_ask_user.py``; the renderers, the reply predicate
and the ContextVars from ``test_agents_research_ask_user_text.py``. Nothing here
constructs a gate except to prove where the assembly hangs it.

**The prompt bytes are the independent variable.** Every arm this feature was
measured on rendered one of these eight states, so a template that drifts makes
the reading unattributable and the shas are pinned rather than described. All
eight are the fork's own numbers, unchanged on this build.

[port] Four adaptations, and nothing else:

* ``DRModeSegmentBuilder`` is ``research_flow.prompts.render_parts``, which
  returns the identity and the contract instead of a ``Segment``; ``_seg``
  performs the builder's own join, so the pinned shas are the same bytes. The
  product seeds those two texts into the workspace as ``soul.md`` / ``agent.md``
  (``agents/raven-research/run.py``) rather than assembling a segment per turn;
* ``build_dr_flow`` is ``research_flow.flow.build_chain``, which takes tool
  handles and a session store and prepends its own ``TurnFrame``. The one
  assembly fact read here is where the gate sits relative to the ``GatedHook``
  wrap, which the port preserves;
* the conversation module was carried into the plugin rather than edited, so
  "not modified" is asserted against ``research_flow.gates.conversation`` and
  the fork's sha still holds;
* the open clarify round lives in the plugin's ``SessionStore``, keyed by
  session key, not on ``session.metadata``; the fork-inheritance property is
  asserted in the session file (this file carried a twin of it until the two
  merged, 2026-08-31).
