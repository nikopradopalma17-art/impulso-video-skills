"""Whether a provider is usable, asked of every module that answers it.

Decided in one place, ``providers.auth``. Three modules used to decide it
independently and disagreed:

* ``config.schema.section_has_credentials`` gates routing -- a section it rejects is
  skipped when matching a model id to a provider.
* ``config.update_providers.list_providers`` gates display -- it is what
  ``raven provider list`` and the pickers show.
* ``providers.factory.check_provider_credentials`` gates startup -- it decides
  whether ``raven agent`` runs at all.

A provider the second accepted and the first rejected was configured according
to the CLI and invisible to the router -- Gemini holding only ``api_key_list``
read as ready in ``provider list`` and refused to start.

(``registry.auth_shape`` is deliberately absent: it answers what shape a
provider's credentials take, not whether they are present. It is a fourth
implementation of a different question.)

These assert the one answer, and that all three ask it. The per-implementation
records exist so that a change to any single answer is visible rather than
silently rebalancing them back into disagreement.
