"""Every path, environment variable and helper name in the prompt, read back off the code.

`tests/ppt/_skill_claims.py` checks the skill, and only the skill. Everything else that
reaches a model -- the workspace templates the context builder injects on every turn,
the tool descriptions, the strings the tools and stages hand back, and the docstrings of
the helper modules written into the author's build directory -- had no reader at all,
and two of them had been wrong for long enough to survive a directory rename: `TOOLS.md`
sent the build script to `ppt_projects/<project>/build/build.py` after the layout had
become `deck/build/`, and the subagent launcher looked for the finished deck in
`exports/` after `Project.exports_dir` had become `out/`.

Nothing here is written down twice. The directory names come off `Project`'s own
properties, the environment variables off the assignments in the script runner, the tool
names off `build_ppt_tools`, and the helper symbols off an `ast` walk of the source the
asset service emits -- so renaming a directory breaks this file's expectations with it
rather than leaving the gate agreeing with a stale document.

What it deliberately does not do is read prose for meaning. A claim about behaviour
("the build refuses X") is not checkable here; what is checkable is that every name the
prose uses is a name the code answers to.

# The launcher-lane half of the fork file (its `launcher` fixture and the
# rendered-config tests) does not board: the product launcher's render claims
# are pinned by tests/test_agents_ppt_launcher.py, the shipped config is pinned
# byte-for-byte against the fork's there (modulo the engine slice), and the
# material_section entry point retired with the CLI job mode (dead-freight
# verdict 3). The per-test accounting is in the wave draft's conservation audit.
