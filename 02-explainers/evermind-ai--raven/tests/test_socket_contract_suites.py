"""Socket conformance suites — the S2 pattern, prototyped on the two hardest
sockets (provider, executor) with built-in bite-tests.

Ruling basis (2026-08-26): replacement clears three gates = the paper
(shape) + the socket conformance test (behavior) + the baseline diff.
This file is gate two's exemplar: a reusable checker per socket that ANY answer
(factory, shelf, third-party) must pass before it may occupy the socket. The
provider methods are the MEASURED surface (campaign A), not a designed one.
The response members are read off the paper's dataclass, so the suite checks
every member the paper declares the day it declares it; the seven the campaign
measured (campaign A plus the three fields every seven-swap run died on) stay
pinned as the floor the paper may not drop below.
