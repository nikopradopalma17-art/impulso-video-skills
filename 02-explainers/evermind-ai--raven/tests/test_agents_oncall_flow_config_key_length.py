"""A trial's name has to fit on a filesystem, and it did not.

``config_key`` spells every key and value into the name, which is what makes a
status output readable -- ``deltaT5em4_run1`` says what it is. But a value can be
a filesystem path, and then the name inherits its length and its separators.

Measured 2026-08-13 on the ML campaigns: the key was **255 bytes**, exactly
``NAME_MAX``. It survived only because the ``eval_data`` value's slashes split it
into seven nested directories -- and that nesting broke something else, the
backend's spend probe globs ``jobs/*/`` one level deep, so a running job reported
0.0 minutes used. Flattening the slashes would have produced a single 255-byte
name with **no headroom at all**: writing ``lr`` as ``1.5e-05`` instead of
``2e-05`` would then fail with ENAMETOOLONG and the job would not start.

So values that are long or contain separators are folded to a short digest, and
the whole name is capped. What stays readable stays readable; the parts that were
never readable anyway become eight characters.

Determinism is not negotiable: this key is the idempotency key, and re-submitting
the same config must return the original job rather than start a second one. That
rules out a random id, and it is why a digest rather than a counter.
