"""Working inside a user's template: preparing it, reading it, reusing its pages.

The measurements behind these tests were taken on the 193 templates the user
supplied, and two of them decide the design:

85% of a template's visual elements live on its example slides rather than on its
layouts, so those slides are the reference and `add_slide(layout)` is not. And two
thirds of those pages hold something python-pptx cannot write -- custom geometry,
a gradient, a fill at 60% opacity -- so cloning a page is not a convenience beside
the decompiler, it is the only way that part of a template reaches a deck at all.
