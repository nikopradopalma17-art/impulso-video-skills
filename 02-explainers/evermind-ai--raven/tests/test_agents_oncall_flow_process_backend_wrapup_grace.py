"""A job that has stopped running has not necessarily finished.

The pid file does not name the job. A job script writes its solver's pid there
so the backend's ``cancel`` can reach the solver, and the script keeps running
its own wrap-up after that solver exits -- a final progress line, a log tail,
several greps over the solver log.

Measured 2026-08-14 on the FEA contact trial:

    11:41:18  solver exits
    11:41:22  probe reads "gone", records "ended from outside"
    11:41:31  script writes result.json: succeeded, rc=0

The ledger said failed while the job said succeeded. The loop spent the rest of
that campaign unsure which was true and ended it with 84% of the budget unspent.
A first "gone" therefore only starts a wait; a job truly ended from outside stays
gone and is reported that way once the wait is over.
