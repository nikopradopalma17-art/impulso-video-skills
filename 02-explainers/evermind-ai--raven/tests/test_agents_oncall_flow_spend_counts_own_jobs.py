"""A campaign's spend is its own jobs, even when campaigns share a rounds directory.

Measured 2026-09-11 on a shared 2xA800 box: five campaigns of one task declared
the same ``remote_dir``, so ``runs/jobs/`` held every round's jobs. The spend
scan walked the directory, and the second-round campaign (budget 130) read 125.6
spent on its first look -- 34.6 of it its own, the rest two earlier rounds --
and stopped with 142 real minutes unspent and fifteen runs never submitted.
