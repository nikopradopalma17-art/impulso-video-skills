"""Tools the operator switched off: withheld per assembly, not unregistered.

The behaviour these exist for is one sentence -- flip a switch, and the next
request reflects it, in both directions. It used to be neither: the off switches
were read once into the constructor and applied by *unregistering* the tool, so
turning one off needed a restart and turning one back on was not merely
unimplemented but unimplementable, because nothing remembered what to put back.

So what is pinned here is that the registry keeps the tool and leaves it out of
the array, that it asks for the current answer rather than a remembered one, and
that both surfaces a tool can be reached through agree -- a tool hidden from the
schema but findable through tool-search would be worse than one that was never
hidden, because the model would call something that is not supposed to be there.
