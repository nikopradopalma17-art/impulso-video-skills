"""Closing is the one irreversible step, and an unanswered question is the
strongest reason not to take it.

Measured 2026-08-14: an arm asked the owner twice, heard nothing, and concluded
'done' with 84% of the budget unspent and its objective never measured. It
neither waited nor continued -- it quit, and the ledger shut with the budget
inside it. Waiting costs nothing by comparison: the campaign stays open and one
sentence restarts it.
