"""Bedrock is a warning-suppress stub, not a real backend.

Two things are pinned so that actually wiring a Bedrock `converse` backend
later will break a test and force this file to be revisited:

  (a) the import-time log filter drops only the two known LiteLLM
      botocore-preload warnings and nothing else;
  (b) there is no Bedrock code path — no `bedrock` provider spec, and the sole
      bedrock touchpoint in providers/factory.py is the ``model.startswith("bedrock/")``
      key-gate bypass that falls through to LiteLLM (no `converse` call).

    The gate used to let it through on ``model.startswith("bedrock/")`` written

    environment, so demanding an ``api_key`` would demand something the user does
    not have in that form -- but stating it as a prefix test put a fact about how
    a vendor authenticates inside a startup check, where nothing else could see
    it. It is now one entry in ``providers.auth``, alongside the other shapes.
