"""`raven ops connection` -- the front door that replaced hand-editing the file.

What these pin is the one guarantee the command adds over an editor: nothing is
written until the machine itself has answered. The registry is the input every
on-call gate reads and the only one nothing was checking, so a row that cannot
be reached must not reach it -- an absent machine is a question the loop knows to
ask, an unreachable one is a fact it acts on.

`--non-interactive` is covered as its own path rather than as a convenience. A
TUI cannot prompt (`cli.dispatch` runs a command in-process and hands back
stdout), so that flag is the only form the main agent can drive, and the probe
has to still have the last word in it.
