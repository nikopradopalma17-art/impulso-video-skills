"""A constraints export must drop every workspace member, not only the root.

``uv tool install -c`` rejects unnamed requirements, and ``uv export
--no-emit-project`` keeps workspace members in the output as unnamed
editables (``-e ./plugins-dist/...``), so every installer that exports the
lock into a constraints file broke the moment ``plugins-dist/*`` joined the
workspace. The trunk's export sites therefore use ``--no-emit-workspace``,
which drops the members along with the root.

This contract is the tripwire for every export site in the repo: any site
whose owning pyproject declares a workspace must use
``--no-emit-workspace``. The sites span shell, PowerShell, YAML, and
Python, which is why it reads text rather than ASTs. (The vendored forks
this file also used to watch retired with their trees; their
``--no-emit-project`` was correct to the end, since none declared a
workspace.)
