"""A second task in the same instance, which is how anyone actually uses this.

Asked on 2026-08-13: "will a user just run `raven tui` once and then do task A
and task B in a row?" The answer was no, in two places, and neither had been
noticed for a month because every experiment passes ``--config`` -- so each
instance held exactly one campaign and neither path was ever walked. The
apparatus was shaped unlike the product, so it could not measure the product's
faults.

**Locating with no name.** ``_resolve_campaign_dir`` counted every directory
under the ops home, concluded or not, and refused as ambiguous from the second
task onward. The cron service, deciding the same "which campaign" question,
already skips concluded ones; the two disagreed and this was the side that was
wrong. When every campaign is finished the answer is not a list of names either:
the previous piece of work is over, and this is new work.

**Naming a finished campaign.** Task statements no longer mention a campaign
name, so the agent invents one, and two similar tasks colliding is not unlikely.
The collision landed on the wrong message: "CONCLUDED by the user; not
submitting" reads as a state or permission problem rather than "you picked a name
that is taken". An agent that reads it that way reaches for ``concluded.json``
with ``edit_file``, or edits meta.json -- the exact apparatus-editing behaviour
measured on 2026-08-12, with the trigger once again on our side.

Refusing is kept (a) because a finished campaign's record is what a report was
filed against, and (b) because nothing here can tell "continue that work" from
"different work, same word". What changes is that the refusal names the real
cause and says which files not to touch.

Reading a concluded campaign stays allowed: that is how a report gets checked.
