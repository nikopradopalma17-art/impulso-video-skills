"""dr@3.4-askuser: the clarify round at the turn boundary - gate, wrapper, tool.

The hook/tool half of the fork's ``test_agent_flow_ask_user.py``: everything that
drives ``AskUserGate``, ``ClarifyExemptHook``, ``is_prose_clarify`` or
``DRAskUserTool``. The pure text surface it stands on - ``own_text``,
``scaffold_language``, the two renderers, ``is_reply_to``, ``PendingClarify``'s
metadata round trip and the ContextVar accessors - is asserted in
``test_agents_research_ask_user_text.py``, so the two files can move apart
without either losing its subject.

[port] Three of the fork's surfaces have no counterpart on this build and their
assertions are dropped rather than weakened:

* the ``build_dr_flow`` assembly. The plugin's chain is ``research_flow.flow.
  build_chain``, which takes tool handles and a session store and prepends its
  own ``TurnFrame`` - so the fork's observer-name lists are not the same fact,
  and the registration locks they stood for are pinned end to end by
  ``test_agents_research_launcher.py`` instead;
* the segment shas and the identity rewrite, which belong to the prompt surface
  (``research_flow.prompts``) rather than to a gate. The clause is still read
  here wherever the point is that it and the tool description agree about one
  call - two prompt surfaces disagreeing makes a reading unattributable;
* ``terminal_state``: the trunk kernel has no trajectory export, so the gate's
  own namespace on ``ctx.metadata`` is the only observable left.

[port] The handoff and brief scaffolding is English source text rendered through
``raven.i18n.t_in``, so a test that read a Chinese sentence off the render now
asks the catalog for it. Chinese INPUT is still what exercises the language
switch and is spelled with escapes, the way ``ask_user.py`` spells its own CJK
range.
