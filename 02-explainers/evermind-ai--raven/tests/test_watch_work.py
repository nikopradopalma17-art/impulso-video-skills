"""The main agent recognises run-and-watch work and steers it to the on-call agent.

The failure these pin, measured twice: a request naming a solver on this very
computer, a budget, and a shared machine was read correctly and iteration 1
still went straight to a local shell -- with the roster entry saying, in as many
words, that local work counts (2026-08-27). The one channel measured to change
the next move is a line arriving in a tool result, so that is the only place
these tests look for it.

The judgement's own failure modes have to stay silent: it sits in front of every
path-touching tool call, and a parse error there would break looking at files.
