"""What a wake can know about what the last turn worked out.

A wake runs in a fresh session. Measured 2026-08-06 on a real on-call round: one
turn read the case files, derived that the fluid's kinematic viscosity was a
thousand times too large (nu = mu/rho, 1e-3/1000 = 1e-6), and said so; the wake
thirty minutes later opened a different file, reported "numerically normal", and
never mentioned it again. Session files confirm it -- the TUI session mentions
the viscosity four times, the two cron sessions zero.

Two halves are tested here:

  * the conclusion has somewhere to land: ops_check_later requires a basis and
    writes it into the campaign's events;
  * it is handed back at the next wake: ops_tune_status renders the campaign's
    events at call time.

Call time matters. The wake message is written when the wake is *scheduled* and
replayed unchanged when it fires, so anything injected there is a snapshot from
an hour earlier while looking entirely current -- the failure shape this line
keeps meeting, where broken and working produce the same output.
