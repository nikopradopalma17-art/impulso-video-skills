"""Truncation is decided the same way on both response paths.

The agent loop reaches the model two ways: streaming when a caller wired token
callbacks (the TUI), non-streaming when nobody did (``raven agent`` on the
CLI, sub-agents, the sentinel). The detection was originally written inside
the streaming helper, which left every non-streaming caller reporting a
cut-off tool call as a missing required field -- reproduced live as a
twelve-iteration retry loop, the same shape as the incident this work started
from.

These tests pin the decision itself, not the plumbing, so a future path that
forgets to call it is the only way to regress.

    only, and every streaming request went out at 4096 whatever was configured.

    `chat_stream` is the exposed one because the loop calls it directly. `chat`
    is shielded on the loop's own path, which goes through `chat_with_retry`:
    it resolves all three against `self.generation` and always passes them
    explicitly. Five sites do call `provider.chat()` directly (`personalizer`,
    `importer/hermes_user_md`); nothing is shadowed there today because each
    passes `temperature` itself, and none passes `reasoning_effort` -- so a
    literal on `chat` would be inert rather than wrong. That is a weaker
    guarantee than `chat_stream`'s, which is why only the latter is asserted.

    All three parameters, not just the one that started this: fixing
    `max_tokens` alone on three providers left `temperature` and
    `reasoning_effort` shadowed on MiniMax, which is what a reviewer found
    after this test had already been written to check one field.

    Read rather than imported, and over the whole tree rather than
    `raven/providers`. A subclass can live anywhere -- an adapter beside the
    code that uses it -- and importing everything to find one is not available:
    modules under `raven/` parse argv at import time and take the process down
