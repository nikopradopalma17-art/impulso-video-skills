"""dr@3.4-askuser: the clarify round across the turn boundary - consume, persist, classify.

The session-side half of the fork's ``test_agent_flow_ask_user.py``: what the fork's
``AgentLoop`` did around the gate - ``_consume_pending_clarify``,
``_persist_pending_clarify``, ``_inject_research_brief`` and ``_decide_turn_mode`` -
which on this build is one hook, ``research_flow.flow.TurnFrame``, over one store,
``research_flow.state.SessionStore``. The gate and the tool that open a round are
asserted in ``test_agents_research_flow_ask_user.py``; the pure text surface both
stand on in ``test_agents_research_ask_user_text.py``.

[port] The carrier moved. A hook is handed a ``session_key`` and never the
``Session``, so the pending is a field on the plugin's own ``SessionRecord`` - one
JSON file per session under the plugin's state root - instead of
``session.metadata["dr_pending_clarify"]``. That is itself the point the fork's
"not the personalizer's field" test made, so that test is ported against the new
carrier rather than dropped.

[port] Three of the fork's surfaces have no counterpart here and their assertions are
dropped rather than weakened:

* ``terminal_state`` and ``turn_invariants``. The trunk kernel exports no trajectory
  and runs no invariant checker, so ``awaiting_user`` and the ``ask_user`` namespace
  have no stamp to reach. The one fact that survived the move - which channel asked -
  is stamped on ``ctx.metadata["clarify_source"]`` by both paths and is asserted in
  the sibling file;
* ``AgentLoop._process_message``'s personalizer branch. This plugin contributes hooks
  and tools and never names personalization, so there is no supersede to order, to
  warn about, or to read off a source;
* ``_save_turn``'s strip pass. The trunk persists whatever ``before_user_inbound``
  rewrote the inbound to and strips only its own runtime-context tag, so no
  brief-stripping seam exists on this build to assert against.

[port] Chinese INPUT is what exercises the language switch and is spelled with
``\\uXXXX`` escapes, the way ``ask_user.py`` spells its own CJK range.
