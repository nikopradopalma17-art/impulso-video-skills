"""The launcher's own config is the flow we measured, minus a written-down allowlist.

The fork's ``tests/test_shipped_flow_parity.py`` held every config the fork
shipped to the arm that produced published numbers, and the config the deployed
launcher actually served was not one of them: the fork's ``run.py`` defaulted to
the parent folder's ``config.json``, with the ``modes/*.json`` overlays composed
over it per session. That is the product's medium baseline plus its two deeper
modes, and this file holds all three under a parity guard.

The measured side is a frozen snapshot, not a live run: the vendored tree this
file used to probe in a subprocess (effective values through the fork's own
schema and ``build_session_modes``) is retired, and a frozen tree's measurement
is a constant. ``tests/fixtures/vendored_fork/research_parity_probe.json`` is
that constant, captured from the tree at its record commit; the probe source
that produced it lives in this file's own git history (any pre-retirement
revision), so the number can be re-derived from the retired tree in history
whenever the record itself is questioned.

The snapshot also reports the fork's class defaults and retired-label tables, so
the trunk twin (``agents/raven-research/plugins/research-flow``) is held to the
"same fields, same defaults" its docstring promises - the launcher file's slice
test cannot see a default underneath a written value.
