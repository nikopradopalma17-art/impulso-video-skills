"""Orchestration tools are withheld from a loop the host launched as a sub-agent.

``RavenLoopBackend`` builds a sub-agent's registry from an empty ``ToolRegistry``
and never adds ``spawn`` or ``run_subagent_dag``, so an in-process sub-agent
cannot delegate. A ``kind: acp`` agent whose command is ``raven acp`` gets none of
that: the child is a separate process building its own full registry, and it
delegated a DAG node's whole task to a background ``spawn`` whose receipt returns
before any work is done -- twice, ending both turns with a promise instead of the
briefing the node was asked for.

The signal is an environment variable the host injects into every child it
launches, alongside the ``RAVEN_HOME`` it already sends. What the two paths
withhold is one shared set, asserted equal here so neither can drift.
