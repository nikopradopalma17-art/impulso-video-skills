"""The host copy of the registry suite.

Four campaign-facing tests stayed in the on-call fork with the campaign
machinery they exercise (`raven.agent.tools.ops` is not lifted, only the
registry is).

A machine is something the owner set up and named, not something to find.

2026-08-14, two FEA tasks whose statement did not spell the port out: the loop
tried 22, 2222, 8022, 10022, 443, read ~/.ssh/config, pulled a stale port out of
known_hosts and believed it, then read raven's own campaign directory for the
number -- a dozen rounds, no job submitted. It had no way to reach a machine
except to guess at one.

These pin what stops that: the id is what a campaign stores rather than an
address (names are the owner's and change), a row nothing can be run on is
told apart from one that is merely thin, and what leaves this module carries
what decides a machine without carrying the way onto it.
