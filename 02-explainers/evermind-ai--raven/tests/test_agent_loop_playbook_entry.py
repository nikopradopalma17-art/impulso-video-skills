"""A playbook is reached through a tool, never by intercepting the turn.

This file used to assert the opposite: a funnel ran ahead of the turn, and on a
hit it returned the playbook's reply *instead of* running the model, recording
both sides of the exchange itself because it had skipped ``_save_turn``. What is
guarded now is that no such branch exists -- every message reaches the model, and
what the loop does per turn is give the tool the material it needs to describe
itself.
