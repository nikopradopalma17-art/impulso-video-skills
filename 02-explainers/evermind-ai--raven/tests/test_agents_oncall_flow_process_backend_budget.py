"""The compute budget clamps down, never up.

Measured on a watch round: an agent that meant to spend thirty of its hundred
remaining minutes on one round had that written back up to a hundred, because the
backend replaced whatever the caller asked for with everything that was left. The
ceiling belongs to the experiment; the allocation below it is the agent's, and it
was the only allocation decision it had made.

These drive ``submit`` and read the config that reached the remote. A first
version computed ``min()`` in the test itself and passed with the fix reverted --
two of three tests were exercising Python's builtin rather than the backend.
