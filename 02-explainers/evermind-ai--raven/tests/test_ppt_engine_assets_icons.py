"""The icon set as a data file: it loads, it is complete, and a miss answers.

The geometry moved out of a 4197-line Python literal into JSON, which makes two
things worth testing that were not before. The file has to actually load and
validate as part of a normal import path, since a packaging mistake now shows up
as a missing asset rather than a missing module. And nothing that was there may
go: the count is a floor with a whitelist under it, because the set grows and an
icon that quietly stops resolving breaks a deck that already used it.

The rest is about lookup. An author on the script route does not get a schema
enum, so the only thing standing between it and an unusable icon field is what
happens when a name misses -- and at thirteen hundred names, what happens when
the word it wants is in no name at all.
