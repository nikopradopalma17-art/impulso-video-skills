"""dr@3.4-askuser: how the flow assembles the clarify round.

The assembly half of the fork's ``test_agent_flow_ask_user.py``: what the two
knobs resolve to, what ``research_flow.flow.build_chain`` wires when they are
on, what ``research_flow.prompts`` renders into the identity and the contract,
and what ``TurnFrame`` does with an open round at the two turn boundaries. The
gate and tool behaviour this stands on is driven from
``test_agents_research_flow_ask_user.py``; the pure text surface from
``test_agents_research_ask_user_text.py``.

[port] The fork read all of this off one ``build_dr_flow`` assembly object. Six
of its surfaces have no counterpart on this build and their assertions are
adapted or dropped rather than weakened:

* ``DRModeSegmentBuilder``. The plugin renders the same bytes through
  ``research_flow.prompts.render_parts`` and the product's launcher seeds them
  into the workspace as ``soul.md`` + ``agent.md`` (``agents/raven-research/
  run.py``), so a fork assertion about the segment TEXT is read off the
  renderer, and the four measured shas still hold to the byte;
* ``tools_allowlist``. The plugin does no allowlist slimming - the product
  shapes its tool face with ``tools.disabledTools`` - so the fork's three
  allowlist tests are dropped rather than rewritten against a different lock;
* the tool REGISTRY. The trunk registers the plugin's contribution, so what the
  fork asserted about ``AgentLoop.tools`` is pinned end to end by
  ``test_agents_research_launcher.py``; what survives here is the plugin's own
  half of it - the factory contributes the tool exactly when the clause names
  it, and declines otherwise;
* ``AgentLoop``'s turn seams. The consume / persist / inject work is
  ``TurnFrame``'s, and is driven as such below; the persistence STRIP is the
  trunk loop's ``_save_turn`` and is not the plugin's to assert;
* the bench tooling around the prompt - the segment/tool stamp script and the
  ``examples/*.json`` arm profiles it stamped. Neither came across: the product
  ships one profile, ``agents/raven-research/config.json``, and what that
  profile opens is pinned end to end by ``test_agents_research_launcher.py``;
* the personalizer precedence. The fork's loop asked its assembly whether
  ask_user superseded the built-in clarify path; the trunk's personalizer sits
  behind a loop-level switch no plugin can read, so that arbitration has no
  seam on this build.

[port] The turn-scoped state crosses a phase boundary the fork never had: the
trunk builds one ``AgentHookContext`` per phase, so ``ctx.metadata`` does not
carry from ``before_user_inbound`` to ``before_iteration`` and the clarify
verdict reaches the turn-mode decision through its ContextVar instead. The
scenarios below therefore build a context per phase, the way the loop does.

[port] Chinese INPUT is what exercises the reply/new-request split, and it is
spelled with escapes: ``raven/i18n/`` is the only place in this repo that
carries CJK text.
