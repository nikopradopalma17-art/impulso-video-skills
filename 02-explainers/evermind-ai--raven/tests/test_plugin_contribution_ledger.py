"""The contribution surface's ledger: the plugin-facing vocabulary, pinned.

``ServiceLocator`` and ``RuntimeHandles`` are papers now
(``raven.contracts.plugin_surface``, under the contract tier's version and
ledger); ``PluginManifest`` stays plugin-side because paper-izing a pydantic
model would pull pydantic into the kernel closure. This file keeps what the
tier ledger does not pin: the exact field rosters, the frozenness, the
manifest vocabulary, and the re-export address plugin authors import from.
