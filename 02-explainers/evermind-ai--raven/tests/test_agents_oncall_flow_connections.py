"""The campaign-facing half of the connections suite.

The registry suite itself lives on trunk (tests/test_ops_connections.py);
these stayed behind with the campaign machinery they exercise -- the backend
seam reading a campaign's named connection, the submit path refusing to bury
it, and the listing saying which machine holds the work. The plugin reads the
registry through trunk's module since 2026-09-23, so the store is patched
where the reader lives.
