"""The routes, and the promises that hold across all of them.

Two of these tests exist because the predecessor broke exactly here. One route
became unreachable under every configuration -- a predicate contradicted itself
-- and the suite had frozen the unreachability as expected behaviour, so 1500
lines of tooling sat dead for months. The other is the hard invariant about
physical quantities, which lived in prose and therefore could not fail.
