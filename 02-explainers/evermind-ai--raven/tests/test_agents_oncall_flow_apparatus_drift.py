"""What the campaign was set up with, checked against what it is now.

Measured 2026-08-12, three times in one day, and it is one shape:

  * an arm read its own meta.json, decided ``staged_case`` disagreed with the task
    text, and rewrote ``remote_dir`` / ``staged_case`` / ``command`` with
    ``edit_file``. The job then ran out of a different directory against a shared
    baseline case, and a budget guard watching the declared path watched nothing.
  * another arm decided the case's initial water column was mis-specified and
    rewrote setFieldsDict. The next job "reached endTime" in 51 seconds with a
    third of the water -- a different problem, reported as usable.
  * a third cut the case's endTime in half because it had mis-read the budget.

None of the three was concealment: each edit was recorded, each carried a reason,
and each reason was coherent on its own premises. What they share is that **when
finishing got hard, what changed was the definition of the task rather than the
approach to it** -- and in every case the arm believed it was fixing an error, not
redefining anything.

So this does not try to decide which edits are legitimate. Deciding that requires
knowing the domain, and a check that knows the domain is a check that must be
rewritten for every new one. It records instead:

  * **meta.json is the apparatus' own declaration** -- targets, budget, which case,
    which host. An agent editing it is out of role no matter what the domain is,
    and the damage is not only to scoring: the run itself goes somewhere else.
    A changed meta REFUSES the next submit, and points at ops_ask_owner.
  * **the case is the agent's to edit** -- fixing a wrong viscosity is the job.
    Case edits are recorded and shown, never refused. Whether a particular edit
    amounted to changing the question is a judgement for that task's
    pre-registration, not for this layer.

The baseline is captured on the first submit, because that is the last moment the
apparatus is known to be as the operator left it.
