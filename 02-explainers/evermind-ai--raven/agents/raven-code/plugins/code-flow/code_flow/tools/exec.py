"""exec -- the host's shell tool with the fork's fixes, served by name.

The trunk ``ExecTool`` is kept whole (its guards, its background lane, its
machine lane); this subclass changes what a coding run kept tripping over, and
does it on the executor seam ``ExecTool.__init__`` already exposes:

*A long timeout is clamped, not refused.* Trunk's schema says ``maximum: 600``,
so a model asking for 900 seconds for a slow test suite is answered with a
validation error and learns nothing. Here the schema carries no maximum, the
request is clamped to the configured ceiling, and the result says so.

*A timed-out command says so, in as many words.* Trunk's executor used to wait
on ``communicate()``, so when that raised on timeout the buffered output was
gone and the model read ``Timed out after 600s`` with nothing else -- for a
test suite that printed forty passes and one hang, the forty passes vanished.
Trunk drains the pipes itself now and hands back what arrived, so the output is
no longer what separates the two. What remains here is the reading: trunk
signals the kill through ``exit_code`` and a stderr line, while
``CodeExecResult`` flags ``timed_out`` and renders ``TIMED_OUT_NOTE``, which
tells the model the output is a fragment rather than the whole run. The drain
below therefore duplicates trunk's; retiring it is the fork owners' call, and
nothing depends on which of the two performs it.

*A large output is saved whole, not lost in the middle.* Trunk keeps the head
and the tail of 10,000 characters; the middle is nowhere. Here the budget is
30,000 and the complete output is written under Agent home (never into the
repository), with the path in the result, so the model can grep it instead of
re-running blind.

Sandbox discipline: this executor runs on the host, exactly as the trunk's
``DirectExecutor`` does when ``tools.sandbox.backend`` is ``none``. The factory
serves this tool only in that case and declines otherwise, so a configured
sandbox is never bypassed by a same-name replacement.

Environment discipline: the host executor hands a child only an allowlisted
baseline of the process environment (never credentials), and that allowlist is
a private detail of the trunk module -- a product plugin may not import it
(the cargo redlines). So the baseline is learned from the host executor itself:
one probe command run through the public ``exec`` reports which variables a
child receives, and this executor passes exactly those, read fresh from the
process environment at every spawn. No copy of the list, so no drift.
