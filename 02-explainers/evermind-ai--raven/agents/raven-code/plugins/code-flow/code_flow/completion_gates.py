"""Completion-gate guardrail: empty-diff falsification, plus the shared switch helper.

Ported whole from the fork (fork raven/agent/loop/completion_gates.py, 207
lines, stdlib self-contained), with ``format_gate_counters`` joining from the
fork loop's own accounting (fork loop/main.py:115-118) -- the counters ride
the plugin's turn-frame hook once the injection axes board a later wave.

Evidence base (2026-08, trajectory error analysis across two independent model rounds
on this harness; the full evidence chain lives in the guardrail design notes, not here):
both rounds occasionally finish a change-the-code task with an EMPTY diff while claiming
the repository already satisfies the requirement. One failing trajectory even ran a
plausible-looking falsification experiment -- against the wrong check -- so a weak
"are you sure?" reminder is not enough. The gate asks for the one piece of evidence that
actually discriminates: the task's own acceptance or reproduction steps executed against
the current, unmodified code.

Design constraints shared with the other guardrails (see the fork's guardrail
design notes): at most one injection per turn, the framework states verifiable
facts and leaves the ruling to the model, ambiguity means silence, and nothing
is injected on the final iteration (no room left to act). The gates target the
autonomous single-task coding mode; interactive sessions leave them off by
default.

evidence: execute the task's own acceptance or reproduction steps against the current, \
