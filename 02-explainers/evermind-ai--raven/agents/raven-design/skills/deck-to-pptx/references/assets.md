# Pictures, icons and evidence

## Finding a real picture

A logo, a product screen, a published chart, a paper's own figure and a photograph of a
real place exist already. Search for those. Generate only what does not exist:
illustration, backdrop, atmosphere.

**Never generate a substitute for something real** -- a product UI, a logo, a person, a
scientific result, a published figure, a statistical claim. A drawn approximation of a real
mark is not a placeholder, it is a page stating something false about a thing that exists.
If the search finds nothing, the page says so and names who can supply it.

Search the whole deck at once, before the first page is drawn: go through the plan page by
page, name the picture each one wants, and run them together. The pool is what the pages
choose from; one query per page, asked while that page is being drawn, gets whatever comes
back. Search what the material names -- a product, a company, a standard, a benchmark, a
paper -- and the furniture no material ever links: the logos and the marks.

`web_search` returns pages. For pictures call `image_search`, with every picture the deck
needs as `queries=[...]` in one call; the results come back grouped by query. Each hit
carries the direct image URL, its pixel size, the domain and the page it came from, and
anything under 640px wide or 360px tall is already dropped.
Keep the page link beside what you took: it is what the page's source note credits. When
`image_search` is not in your tool list the pictures may still be findable: `web_search` for the
page that carries one -- the project site, the paper, the vendor, the museum -- and `web_fetch`
it. Where the text it returns keeps the image links, download one in the build script. Some
fetch backends strip them; then the page goes without.

Look at what you fetched before placing it. A hit that is the right size can still be a
thumbnail sheet, a watermarked stock frame, or somebody else's slide about the subject.

A fetched mark that already has an alpha channel lands on the page's own ground with
nothing behind it. The worst thing to do with a cut-out is to box it in a white rectangle.

## A paper's figures and formulas

Both run on `raven-python`.

```python
import pymupdf

doc = pymupdf.open("paper.pdf")

# Find the figure by its caption (with the colon), whichever page carries it.
page, caption = next((p, hit) for p in doc for hit in p.search_for("Figure 2:"))

# A raster figure is embedded as an image and comes out at its own resolution.
for i, info in enumerate(page.get_images(full=True)):
    pix = pymupdf.Pixmap(doc, info[0])
    if pix.n - pix.alpha >= 4:
        pix = pymupdf.Pixmap(pymupdf.csRGB, pix)
    pix.save(f"assets/p{page.number + 1}_img{i}.png")

# A vector figure or a table has no embedded image: crop the region above the caption,
# look at the crop, move the rectangle until the whole figure and nothing else is inside.
region = pymupdf.Rect(page.rect.x0 + 40, caption.y0 - 300, page.rect.x1 - 40, caption.y0 - 4)
page.get_pixmap(clip=region, dpi=220).save("assets/fig2.png")
```

```python
from raven_ppt.services.assets.formulas import add_formula

shape = add_formula(
    slide,
    r"L(\theta)=L_{\mathrm{new}}(\theta)+\frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_i F_i\,(\theta_i-\theta^{*}_{i})^{2}",
    left_in=0.8, top_in=2.6, size_pt=18, colour="1F2A44", serif=False,
)
```

`size_pt` = the body size beside it. `serif=True` for a deck set in a serif face. `colour` =
the deck's ink. `max_width_in` scales a long expression down to a column. `\mathrm{}` sets a
word upright. No `\text{}`, no `align`, no matrix; prose stays outside the expression. The
returned shape carries the `width` and `height` to make room for.

Symbols inside a sentence are text, set as runs with real scripts rather than a picture:

```python
from raven_ppt.services.assets.formulas import math_runs

paragraph = box.text_frame.paragraphs[0]
math_runs(paragraph, "旧后验 p(θ | D_A) 由 F_i 和 θ* 决定", size_pt=16, colour="1F2A44")
```

`_A` and `_{new}` subscript; `^2` and `^{T}` superscript; `θ*` is θ with a raised star. A
plain Greek letter or a word needs neither call.

## Generating one

```python
image_generate(
    prompt="<subject, mood, what to leave out>",
    images=["/abs/path/logo.png"],      # up to 6 on a chat-routed model, 16 on gpt-image
    aspect_ratio="16:9",
)
```

- `images` takes local paths, http(s) URLs or data URIs. Put the brand mark there rather
  than describing it.
- Name the region the type needs, by side and by share: `the left 55% of the canvas stays
  almost pure dark, reserved for title text`.
- End every prompt with `no text, no letters, no numbers`.
- Render the page afterwards and look at it.
- No image key configured: the tool says so. Say which pages would have had a picture.

## A cut-out that really has an alpha channel

An illustration that floats on the page's own ground needs transparency, and asking for
"a transparent background" in words returns a drawn checkerboard. Generate the subject on a
green screen and key it out:

```python
CUT_OUT = (
    "Transparent-background production constraint: generate the subject on a solid pure "
    "green background, hex #00ff00. Keep the background flat, evenly lit and shadow-free; "
    "do not use green in the subject, its reflections, glow or edge details; nothing "
    "touches the edges of the image. The green will be removed by chroma keying into a "
    "real alpha channel."
)
```

```python
import io
from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

DESPILL_REACH = 5


def is_screen_green(r, g, b):
    if g >= 145 and r <= 130 and b <= 130 and g - max(r, b) >= 35:
        return True
    top, low = max(r, g, b), min(r, g, b)
    if top == 0 or g <= r or g <= b:
        return False
    spread = top - low
    if spread == 0:
        return False
    hue = 60 * ((b - r) / spread + 2)
    return 80 <= hue <= 160 and spread / top >= 0.35 and top / 255 >= 0.45


def key_out_green(png: bytes) -> tuple[bytes, float]:
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(png)).convert("RGBA")
    width, height = image.size
    pixels = image.load()
    keyed = Image.new("L", image.size, 0)
    marks = keyed.load()
    count = 0
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            r, g, b, _ = pixels[x, y]
            if is_screen_green(r, g, b):
                marks[x, y] = 255
                count += 1
    near = keyed.filter(ImageFilter.MaxFilter(DESPILL_REACH)).load()
    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            r, g, b, a = pixels[x, y]
            if marks[x, y]:
                pixels[x, y] = (r, g, b, 0)
            elif near[x, y] and g > max(r, b):
                pixels[x, y] = (r, max(r, b), b, a)
    out = io.BytesIO()
    image.save(out, format="PNG")
    return out.getvalue(), count / float(width * height)
```

Every pixel is tested, so the pockets a flood from the border cannot reach -- between an arm
and a body -- go too. The rim a few pixels wide around what was keyed is despilled: an edge
pixel that blended with the screen has more green than its other channels, and taking that
excess off leaves the subject's colour instead of a green fringe.

**Under 20% keyed means it is not a cut-out.** The model painted a scene rather than a
subject on the screen. Ask again with one subject and nothing behind it.

## Icons

1304 outline icons ship beside this agent. Each carries its upstream tags, so search by what
the unit is about.

```python
from raven_ppt.services.assets.icons import icon_candidates, icon_paths, resolve_icon_name

icon_candidates("deadline")     # -> calendar_due
icon_candidates("risk")         # -> warning
icon_candidates("inventory")    # -> building_warehouse
resolve_icon_name("map-pin")    # -> map_pin
```

Ask one concrete word at a time. An abstraction (`throughput`, `supply chain`) returns
nothing usable.

`icon_paths(name)` returns the strokes on a 24x24 grid as `(op, coords)` pairs: `M` starts a
run, `L` adds a point, `C` is a cubic carrying two control points then its endpoint. There is
no `Z`. Draw them as freeforms:

```python
from pptx.dml.color import RGBColor
from pptx.util import Emu, Pt
from raven_ppt.services.assets.icons import icon_paths

EMU, STYLE = 914400, "{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/presentationml/2006/main}style"


def icon_runs(name):
    runs = []
    for path in icon_paths(name):
        run, here = [], None
        for op, xy in path:
            if op == "M":
                if len(run) > 1:
                    runs.append(run)
                here = (xy[0], xy[1])
                run = [here]
            elif op == "L":
                here = (xy[0], xy[1])
                run.append(here)
            elif op == "C" and here is not None:
                (x0, y0), (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3) = here, xy
                for step in range(1, 9):
                    t, u = step / 8, 1 - step / 8
                    run.append((u**3 * x0 + 3 * u * u * t * x1 + 3 * u * t * t * x2 + t**3 * x3,
                                u**3 * y0 + 3 * u * u * t * y1 + 3 * u * t * t * y2 + t**3 * y3))
                here = (x3, y3)
        if len(run) > 1:
            runs.append(run)
    return runs


def add_icon(slide, name, left_in, top_in, size_in, rgb, width_pt=1.5):
    scale, pen = size_in * EMU / 24.0, Pt(width_pt)
    for run in icon_runs(name):
        pts = [(left_in * EMU + x * scale, top_in * EMU + y * scale) for x, y in run]
        xs, ys = [x for x, _ in pts], [y for _, y in pts]
        dot = max(max(xs) - min(xs), max(ys) - min(ys)) < pen
        if dot:
            pts = [(xs[0], ys[0]), (xs[0] + pen, ys[0]), (xs[0] + pen, ys[0] + pen), (xs[0], ys[0] + pen)]
        builder = slide.shapes.build_freeform(Emu(int(pts[0][0])), Emu(int(pts[0][1])))
        builder.add_line_segments([(Emu(int(x)), Emu(int(y))) for x, y in pts[1:]], close=dot)
        shape = builder.convert_to_shape()
        if dot:
            shape.fill.solid()
            shape.fill.fore_color.rgb = RGBColor.from_string(rgb)
            shape.line.fill.background()
        else:
            shape.fill.background()
            shape.line.color.rgb = RGBColor.from_string(rgb)
            shape.line.width = pen
        for style in shape._element.findall(STYLE):
            shape._element.remove(style)
```

A run whose whole span is thinner than the pen is one of upstream's dots: fill it rather than
stroke it. The `p:style` element has to go or the theme adds a shadow.

Where that import is unavailable, design the marks yourself. Do not generate them as
pictures.
