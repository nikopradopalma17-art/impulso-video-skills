"""FlowConfig: the research flow's knobs, ported from the fork's ``DRFlow*Config`` models.

Same sub-model shapes as the fork's ``raven/config/raven.py``, and the same fields and
defaults except where this twin has moved past the vendored record: that retired checkout
was kept at upstream ``a903a424`` while the twin takes upstream's later changes directly, and every
such lead is named in ``TWIN_LEADS`` (``tests/test_agents_research_flow_parity.py``), which
fails on any difference it does not name. What changed otherwise is only the trunk seam
the config arrives through.
The slice reaches the plugin as a plain dict with camelCase keys exactly as the product
writes them in ``config.json`` (``plugins.config["research-flow"]``), so every model here
accepts both camelCase and snake_case (``alias_generator=to_camel`` +
``populate_by_name``) and ignores unknown keys instead of forbidding them - the slice
also carries plugin-only keys (``search.apiKey``, ``fetch.apiKey``, ``proxy``,
``stateRoot``) that the flow models do not own.

Four of the fork's fields are deliberately absent: ``toolsAllowlist``,
``minimalContext``, ``truncationWrapup`` and ``reactiveClamp`` were consumed by
the fork's LOOP, and no seam here reaches them. See ``_RETIRED_KEYS`` for who
owns each surface now and why they are not merely accepted and ignored.

Three fields are this product's own and the fork has no twin for them: ``evidenceFloor``,
the per-mode evidence demand that makes ``max`` a different stop rule (see
``gates/evidence_floor.py``); ``sufficiency.judgeListing``, the pre-page judgement that
lets a settled question ship on search snippets; and ``plainFirst``, the first-reply
experiment that withholds the web tools until the model has answered or asked for
research (``gates/plain_first.py``). The parity test names all three, so a fourth has to
be declared there too rather than slipping in beside them.

``with_overlay`` is the per-mode entry point: a session mode's ``drFlow`` diff
(camelCase, arbitrary depth) is deep-merged over the base dict and the result
re-validated, so a mode changes exactly the knobs it names and nothing else.
