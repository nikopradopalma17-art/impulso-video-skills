"""Client-side observation ledger: append-only, write-only, read by nobody at run time.

Off until the plugin names a directory with :func:`set_ledger_dir`, so a process
that never configures it writes nothing. It records, it never decides.

Why client-side rather than a service log: on a fixed corpus the retrieval service is
ours and its log is the most stable dependency there is - it records what was really
returned, so nothing can be recomputed into a different answer later. Live web has no
such service. It also has a blind spot the corpus log cannot close: a repeat_notice
cache hit is *defined* as a request that never reaches the service, so a server log
cannot see it, and on one batch 38.1% of a DR arm's search calls were replays. Logging
here sees both, which makes this ledger strictly stronger - but only if the bit is
written at the moment it happens. Reconstructing it afterwards from a rendered
transcript is the thing this is meant to replace.

One file per turn, named by the caller with a run token: concurrent turns run in
their own tasks, so a shared file would interleave, and the token in the filename is
what joins a line back to its turn.

Every record carries ``op``. Readers must partition on it and must count the ops they do
not recognise rather than dropping them - a reader that silently ignores an unknown op
reports a smaller denominator than it measured.

    nothing wrote one on the product side. So the one configuration that asks for an
    appendix was the one configuration that could not get one, and it failed the quiet
    way: ``build_appendix`` returns
    ``("", {"emitted": False, "reason": "ledger_not_configured"})``, the answer is
    returned intact, and nothing logs. The nine bench profiles all pin the knob off, so
    no arm ever exercised the path that needed this.

    Per *turn*, not per process. The appendix reads the whole file, and the runtime is
    long-lived on the product side (one instance serves a whole session), so a
    per-process file would render turn five's trail with turns one through four's
    searches in it - a trail that overstates what this answer rests on. Bench gets this
    right by construction: one file per question-arm, one question per process.

    Failure is degradation, never an exception: an unwritable directory leaves the
    ledger off and the appendix reports ``ledger_not_configured`` as before. An
    appendix is a nicety; the answer is not.

    Opening twice in one context releases the earlier file rather than stranding it.
    The turn boundary this is called on is the loop's first iteration, and a turn the
    loop re-runs reaches that boundary again; without the release, the first file is

    keeps exactly one row per question. So a single-question ledger can hold two

    ``extbench_20260811/run_dr29``, ``browsecomp-781``: two ``verify_gate
    event=installed`` records 398 seconds apart, 217 lines in the first session and
    **67 in the second that never reached the trajectory**. Any offline replay that
    reads the whole file over-counts that question by 31%.

    Until now the only way to split the sessions was to infer them from
    ``verify_gate installed`` markers - i.e. to recover a fact about the run from a
    behavioural artefact that happens to correlate with it. That is the shape this
    project keeps paying for ("which model served this hop must be a first-class
    field, not reconstructed afterwards"), so it becomes a field.

    Read from the tail, not by scanning: the value is monotonic within a file, so the
    last line carries the maximum, and these files reach tens of thousands of lines.
    Lines with no ``session_seq`` are treated as session 0, which makes an old file's

Why this is a second file rather than more fields on the ledger, which already has a row
per fetch: the ledger's rows are read, and read cheaply. Several consumers partition it
by ``op`` and most only count rows; a fetch row carrying its page would grow the file
from ~5 MB to ~250 MB per run and make every one of them read a quarter of a gigabyte to
count. Worse, :func:`_resolve_session_seq` recovers the re-run split by reading the
**last 64 KB** of the file and parsing the last complete line - a single 250 KB row
leaves no complete line in that window, so the split would silently reset to 1 and an
offline replay would over-count a re-run question exactly the way that function exists
to prevent.

That same argument is why this file does NOT borrow the ledger's ``session_seq``. The
tail read works there because the ledger's rows are small; here the rows are exactly the
oversized ones the paragraph above describes, so a sequence recovered that way resets to
1 on the first record wider than the window and two runs become indistinguishable. Runs
are told apart by :func:`_verbatim_run_id` instead, which is minted in memory and never
recovered from disk.

Off by default and named by the environment rather than the config: the product side is
long-lived and would otherwise accumulate pages per turn with no reader, and a page
store is not a nicety the answer path should ever pay for.

    360-item runs:

      * the **digest** discards the page at the tool seam - the model saw a median 5.59%
        of the fetched text and the remaining 94.41% is not written anywhere;
      * the context **trimmer** replaces 44.9% / 50.2% of tool messages with
        :data:`~research_flow.support.harness_text.TOOL_OUTPUT_ELIDED`, always as a
        prefix, leaving long items about three readable results;

    So "what did this tool actually return" is unanswerable after the fact, and any
