"""Text the harness itself writes into the conversation.

Some bodies in a trajectory did not come from the model and did not come from
the world: the harness wrote them. An elision placeholder standing in for a
dropped tool result, a rule refusing to run a search. They look exactly like
tool output to everything downstream, and two things must never treat them as
evidence:

  * the salvage/verify evidence packs, which would ask a model to answer out of
    a placeholder;
  * the final-answer channel, which would ship the harness's own sentence as the
    run's answer.

The second one is not hypothetical. On the dr@3.0 live-web batch, ``hle-256``
finished with a ``final_answer`` byte-identical to the search-closed notice: the
turn overflowed, 39 of its 43 tool bodies had been elided, the four survivors
were all that same notice, and the salvage model - handed four copies of it as
its only evidence - returned it verbatim. It scored zero on accuracy and, worse,
counted as ``closed_with_answer`` on the answer-rate endpoint.

That failure has three cousins already on the record, which is why this module
exists instead of one more special case: MiroFlow's ``\\boxed{}`` extraction
dropped 10.83% of its own correct answers, dr@1.6's salvage seam blanked 15, and
``_completion_clamp`` was a dead backstop. The last inch of the answer channel
loses answers, repeatedly, and each time the fix was local.

Two predicates, deliberately
----------------------------
``is_harness_authored`` and ``is_harness_echo`` ask the same question and give
different answers, because the two channels have **opposite error preferences**:

  * Evidence selection: a false positive costs nothing - the pack simply reaches
    one item further back. So the predicate may be permissive (substring/prefix).
  * The answer channel: a false positive **destroys a real answer**. That is the
    exact shape of the three failures above. So the predicate must be strict -
    the whole answer has to *be* the harness string, not merely contain it.

Collapsing them into one predicate is wrong on one of the two channels no matter
which strictness is chosen. Anything added below must be added to
``_HARNESS_BODIES`` (permissive matching) and, only if a model could plausibly
emit it as an entire answer, considered for the strict path too.
