"""Sanctioned retrieval round after a verify rejection (DR flow, dr@2.8).

A rejection names decisive claims the gathered evidence does not support. Until
dr@2.8 the only action the flow offered in response was to rewrite the draft
from that same evidence -- ``_REVISION_PROMPT`` said so in as many words -- and
the spin breaker's forced-report note said it a second time. Whenever the reason
a claim is unsupported is that the supporting document was never retrieved, the
recoverable share of that instruction is exactly zero.

This object is the channel between the gate that opens such a round and the two
components that have to behave differently inside it: the search tool, which may
go deeper than the per-call default, and the spin breaker, whose entire purpose
is to stop a turn from re-opening research.

Shared mutable state is deliberate. Hooks have no handle on tool instances --
``AgentHookContext`` carries tool *schemas*, not the registry -- so a flag set on
the context cannot reach the tool that must honour it. The alternative, reading
config at the tool seam, would apply to the flow-off anchor too.

It lives beside ``ledger.py`` under ``support/`` rather than under ``gates/`` for
the reason given there: both a gate hook and a tool need it, and a tool module
importing a gate module is the wrong direction.

The counters are not bookkeeping. A round that never opens, a depth that is
never taken, and a spin pass that never fires are each indistinguishable from
the feature being absent, and the batch that would reveal it costs questions we
cannot get back.
