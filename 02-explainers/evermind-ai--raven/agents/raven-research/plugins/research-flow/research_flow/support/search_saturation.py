"""Per-turn search saturation: notice when searching has stopped finding documents.

A deep-research turn can spend most of its budget re-asking a question the corpus
has already answered as far as it is going to. Measured on one 100-question batch,
1,120 of 5,586 searches were trailing dry spin - 20.1% - and of the 14 questions
that ended with six or more consecutive dry searches, **zero were judged correct**.
One question issued 295 searches, the last 234 of which returned nothing the turn
had not already been shown.

The rule: ``k`` consecutive searches that return no identity new to this turn means
the query family is exhausted. What happens then is a ladder, cheapest rung first -
widen the rendered result list to what the endpoint was already returning (free: the
same one call), then ask for the next page (one extra call), then stop searching -
never "advise the model".

The order is the point. On the live-web axis ``num`` saturates upward but is honoured
downward, and the default rendered width is five, so 64.6% of one batch's DR searches
displayed five rows out of a response that had already returned nine. Buying a second
call before displaying the rows of the first spends quota to get what was on the table.

**Why the action must be control flow.** The model is already being told. With
snippet dedup on, a replay of the live-web batch shows 41.9% of the DR arm's result
slots carry a "you have already seen this" marker, and the model keeps searching
anyway. Adding a sentence would be rerunning an experiment that has already failed
once at scale. So a stopped turn does not receive a recommendation - the call does
not happen. ``web_fetch`` is untouched: every URL already surfaced stays openable,
which is what keeps the priced loss upper bound at zero.

**Why this is its own object.** The mechanism it replaces, dr@2.8's cross-query
dedup, shipped with a counter (``dedup_skipped``) that reads 0 on every search row
of every batch since - so there is no on-disk evidence it ever fired, and its
effect has to be inferred from an unrelated field. That happened because the
counter lived inside a branch that a second, independent config knob decided
whether to enter. Here the state, the decision and the counters are one testable
unit that does not depend on any other knob's setting, and ``counters()`` is
written on every search row including the ones where nothing happened - because a
counter that only appears when the mechanism fires cannot distinguish "did not
fire" from "was not installed".
