"""The ``ask_user`` tool as DR mode presents it — a signal, or a round trip.

Why this is a second class rather than a mode on the kernel's
``raven.agent.tools.ask_user``. That one is live on two transports: the gateway
and the TUI RPC layer each hand it a question broker and resolve its pending
question. It blocks, by contract, and the registry skips its timeout for that
reason. DR mode's default (``askUser.delivery="handoff"``) never blocks:
``AskUserGate`` reads the proposed call in ``before_execute_tools`` and
short-circuits the turn, so the call becomes this turn's reply and the answer
arrives as the next user message.

``delivery="tool"`` is the exception, and it is why this class SUBCLASSES the
blocking tool instead of standing beside it: the gate grants exactly one broker
round trip per turn (read-once, so a call the gate withheld still falls through
to the fallback string), the questions reach the user as a structured prompt,
and the answers return as the tool result — the question text never becomes the
reply. Subclassing keeps every existing wiring seam working unchanged: the TUI
and the gateway late-bind the broker through ``set_broker``, and the loop's
per-turn ``set_context`` matches on ``isinstance(tool, AskUserTool)``.

The description and the parameter schema below are prompt text: they enter the
tool schema the model reads and they move the call rate. The instance is built
once by the flow factory and handed to the gate, so the tool the model sees and
the tool the gate consults are the same object.
