"""Budget visibility for the model (DR flow).

Appends a compact budget line to the newest tool result each iteration,
plus a one-shot converge warning past ``warn_ratio``. Persisted history
is the only train-serve-safe channel for this: the runtime-context block
is stripped on persist and TokenWise rewrites are wire-only, so anything
injected there would be invisible to training. The note is part of the
trajectory **by design** — its exact format is frozen with the flow
version, because trained models condition on it.
