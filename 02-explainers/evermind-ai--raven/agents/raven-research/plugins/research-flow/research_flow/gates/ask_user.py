"""dr@3.4-askuser: one clarify round at the turn boundary (product surface).

Under ``askUser.delivery="handoff"`` (default) the tool call is a **signal**; the
turn boundary is the **transport**. Nothing blocks on a human.
``AskUserGate.before_execute_tools`` reads the proposed call and returns
``short_circuit_result``, so the questions become this turn's reply and the
user's next message arrives as an ordinary inbound. That is why the DR variant of
the tool (the plugin's ``tools/ask_user.py``) does not block by default while
the kernel's ``raven.agent.tools.ask_user`` blocks for the gateway and the TUI.

``delivery="tool"`` swaps the transport, not the discipline: the gate grants the
tool exactly one broker round trip, the questions reach the user as a structured
prompt, and the answers return as the tool RESULT - so the same turn researches
on them, nothing below (pending, brief, chain) is spent, and the question text
never becomes the reply. With no broker wired the gate falls back to the handoff.

Why the short circuit lands in ``before_execute_tools`` and not later: the loop
drops the whole tool-call response there rather than persisting it, so no
dangling ``tool_calls`` reach a strict provider. It also means ``after_iteration``
never runs on a clarify turn, which is what makes the verify gate and the report
bar structurally unreachable here instead of exempted by a flag.

**Two ContextVars, in opposite directions**, for the same reason the conversation
module has three: ``GateCtx`` carries ``session_key`` and not the
``Session``, so a gate can neither read nor write session state.

* ``stash_pending_clarify`` / ``take_pending_clarify`` - gate to loop. The flow
  writes it into the session store next to the research memo. Read-once, so a
  later turn that asked nothing cannot re-persist a stale pending.
* ``set_chain_round`` / ``chain_round`` - loop to gate. The gate needs the chain's
  incoming count to decide ``chain_exhausted``, and the count lives on the
  session. Set on EVERY turn, including to 0: a turn that inherited the previous
  chain's count would be refused a legitimate first question, silently.

**The chain count passes through the consume.** A handoff opens a chain at 1; the
turn that answers carries 1 in, and a second handoff there writes 2. Zeroing on
consume would make round two indistinguishable from round one and ``maxRounds >
1`` unreachable. A turn that researches normally closes the chain by not writing
a new pending, and the count is discarded with it - so the session's next,
unrelated research question gets the full budget. Scoping the budget to the
session instead would refuse it.

**The rendered blocks are prompt text.** ``render_handoff`` is the one artifact
that enters history verbatim, which makes it the independent variable of the
stratum dr@3.4 measured at 2/9 well-formed against 8/14 - a template that varies
would make the first reading unattributable. ``render_brief`` is computed from
the pending state, never asked of the model, and transcribes the user's reply
**verbatim** rather than asserting "the answer is X": that is what caps the cost
of a misread ``is_reply_to`` at one paragraph of stale context instead of a
fabricated question-answer pair.

    chars of English) and, on a later turn, the research memo and a previous

    * the language switch counts the reminder's English words and picks ``en``

    * the brief transcribes the reminder as part of "the original question", and
      the reminder is a block this build strips everywhere else precisely so it

    other Latin text, so its floor sits near 0.18; CJK bigrams are content-bearing
    and unrelated text scores 0. At the configured 0.05 the veto therefore fires
    on CJK and effectively never on English - which is the designed bias direction

    Character bigrams, not words: the questions can be Chinese, where "word
    overlap" needs a tokenizer, and a coarse predicate whose error costs one
    paragraph does not justify a new dependency (AGENTS.md 4).

    One veto, and the asymmetry is deliberate. A new request read as an answer
    costs a stale paragraph in the brief - bounded by the verbatim transcription
    above. An answer read as a new request throws away everything the user just
    said, and they cannot tell that it happened. So only a message that is BOTH
    substantial and lexically unrelated is refused; "option 2" is always an
    answer.

    ⚠️ It does NOT decide only the brief, and an earlier version of this note
    claimed it did. The pending consume also calls ``set_chain_round(0)`` on the
    ``new_request`` branch, and ``chain_round`` is what the gate reads for
    ``chain_exhausted`` - so with ``maxRounds: 1`` this verdict decides whether
    ``ask_user`` is back in the schema on the turn that follows a handoff, brief
    or no brief. The recorded ``reply_overlap`` is therefore partly censored by its
    own threshold, and an offline re-fit has to stratify on whether a second
    handoff happened.

    Whether the turn runs research stays with ``ConversationGate``, which exists
