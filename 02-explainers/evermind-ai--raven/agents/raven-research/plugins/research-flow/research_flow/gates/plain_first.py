"""Plain-first reply (DR flow, product experiment): answer before searching, or ask to.

On the first model call of a plain turn the web tools are withheld and one tool is
added in their place, ``request_research``. A plain turn is a session's first research
turn, or a later turn the conversation gate (``PlainTurnGate``) classed as a new topic
that is settled general knowledge - a third verdict beside research and
answer-from-context, emitted only when this feature is on. The model is told why: answer
now if the question is settled general knowledge, or call the tool. Three things can then
happen to that first response.

* It calls ``request_research`` (or, for models that ignore the tool, writes the research
  marker), or calls something other than the web (a clarify, a file read): the turn goes
  on as an ordinary research turn - the request is popped and a note says the tools are
  back. A tool call is the escalation channel because nothing of it is streamed as text;
  the marker was, and the loop has no way to retract text a client already displayed.
* It is a plain answer and the judge accepts it: the answer stands and reaches the
  terminal gates like any draft. The evidence reviewer has nothing to check it against;
  ``PlainScopedReview`` routes the judged draft past it.
* It is a plain answer the judge refuses, or the judge fails: the draft is kept in
  history as a hypothesis and the turn is sent into research.

The judge is an independent context asked two questions in one call about the question
and the draft: is this settled, time-invariant knowledge that a source could not
change, and is the draft sound - right, consistent, free of claims only a source could
supply? Both are recorded separately and both must hold; one call because each was
measured alone first (5/5 and 3/3 on the common-knowledge set) and the reasoning
model's per-call cost made a second round trip the larger failure surface. Its
failure direction is research, the same as every other judge here. This is the
"plain-first arm" the sufficiency gate's notes record as rejected for the measured
arms, because the decision rests on a prior nobody can check against evidence; it is
built here, off by default and product-only, so that prior can be measured instead of
argued about.

# misreading the schema, and the reviewer measured 44-303s per call on this model with
# no gain from a fresh call, so a restart there only forfeits progress. The re-ask gets
