"""Spin-entry circuit breaker (DR flow).

A research spin usually announces itself in prose before it burns the
budget: "let me start from scratch", "completely different approach",
"going in circles". A density rollback at that point replays the same
entry; the productive intervention is to redirect the turn to commit an
answer from the evidence already gathered.

Three joint criteria separate a spin entry from legitimate re-anchoring
on a secondary lead:

- **repeated restart language** — the first restart phrase of a turn is
  normal research; interception starts at the Nth iteration carrying one;
- **late budget** — restarts early in the turn are exploration;
- **entity overlap** — a restart re-plowing the same candidates shares
  entities with the previous restart, while a legitimate re-anchor
  introduces new ones and passes.

On interception the restart response is popped (its proposed tool calls
are discarded unexecuted) and a persisted user note redirects the
re-sample to write the final answer.
