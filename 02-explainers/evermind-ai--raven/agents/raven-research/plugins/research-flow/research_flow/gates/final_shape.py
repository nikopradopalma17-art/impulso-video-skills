"""Terminal-answer shaping: give the committed answer a machine-readable form.

Why this exists. ``final_answer`` in the evaluation record is the last non-empty
assistant ``content``, verbatim. Measured on a 302-question live-web batch: the
anchor's median is 1,759 characters with a p90 of 41,683, and only 15.6% of its
answers carry any answer marker at all (28.4% on the treated arm). A sampled
treated answer opens with "This is very helpful. According to the Nagada
website: ..." - mid-reasoning self-talk filed as a final answer. The turn's
*ending* is currently a passive event (something truncated it), not an action
the model took, so a report axis run on this shape would measure truncation
rate rather than report quality.

What this module does, and what it deliberately does NOT do. It is a **pure,
deterministic, additive** transform:

* It never invents content. If the visible answer is empty, it stays empty.
* It never shortens. The shaped text is the visible answer plus, at most, one
  appended canonical ``Answer: <span>`` line. ``_content_len`` is asserted
  non-decreasing and the transform falls back to passthrough if that ever
  fails.
* It never replaces the record. The caller keeps the raw text and records this
  result beside it.

That triple is the whole design, and it is a direct response to a measured
failure class rather than a style preference. An upstream framework we
benchmarked runs an answer-extraction stage that is a zero-gain lossy channel:
gold present in its final summary on 71/120 questions, gold surviving into its
boxed field on 58/120 - it produced nothing that was not already there and
dropped 10.83pp on the way. Our own dr@1.6 salvage seam failed the same way.
The rule that came out of both: **answer shaping may improve a record, never
blank one.** A transform that cannot invent an answer also cannot lose one;
here those are the same property, not two.

Score budget is 0 by construction, not by promise. Nothing here reaches the
model or the persisted message sequence - the caller records the result in the
read-only observer payload - so the generated distribution is byte-identical
with the flag on or off. "Rescuing" answerless turns after the fact was priced
separately and only 3-23% of rescues judge correct; the headroom is in
prevention (dr@1.4's +8.50pp), not in shaping. What shaping buys is an
*observable*: a marker rate, and a guaranteed terminal answer line on the turns
where the model cooperated, which is what a report axis needs before it can
measure anything at all.
