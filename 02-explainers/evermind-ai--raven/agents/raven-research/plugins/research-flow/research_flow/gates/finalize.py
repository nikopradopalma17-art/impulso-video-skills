"""Forced-termination backstop (DR flow).

A deep-research turn can end on an assistant message that carries
reasoning but no answer — the visible text after the think block is
empty — or on a degenerate spin dump. Left alone, that message persists
as the final answer and the task scores as unanswered, even though the
working memory usually contains the right candidate.

Two seams reach it. ``after_iteration`` catches turns that reached a text
response, and ``terminal_answerless`` catches the exits no iteration hook
sees — a provider error, an exhausted iteration budget — which is where
most answerless turns actually come from.

Recovery is two-staged and bounded:

1. **Commit nudge** (preferred): pop the answerless response and inject
   a persisted user note telling the model to commit to the
   best-supported answer from the evidence already gathered. The retry
   produces a normally-shaped final turn (reasoning + answer), so the
   trajectory stays training-clean.
2. **Salvage synthesis** (backstop): if the retry still carries no
   answer, one independent-context call — task + reasoning excerpt +
   evidence excerpts — picks the candidate best supported by the
   evidence. The instruction weighs recurrence and evidential support,
   not recency: the last hypothesis a stalled search visited is often a
   drift, not a decision.

Fail-open by contract: the salvage call dying must never silence the
turn — the original message stands and the failure lands in the
observer state.
