"""End-of-turn draft review gate (DR flow).

The candidate final answer is reviewed by an independent context — a
fresh ``[system, user]`` conversation that shares nothing with the
drafting context except the task, the draft, and a fenced evidence
pack. A failed review sends the turn back to solve, up to ``max_revisions``
times per turn (one in the baseline mode, three in the deep modes): the
draft and the reviewer's feedback are injected into history (persisted,
so the draft -> feedback -> revision shape enters the training
distribution) and the loop re-samples.

Fail-open by contract: reviewer infra dying, timing out, or emitting
unparseable output must never silence the turn — the draft passes.

# Why this gate writes to the ledger at all.
#
# Every counter below already existed and was already maintained per turn; none of them
# ever left the process. The only trace was a logger.warning, and the launcher keeps just
# the last 1500 bytes of stderr, so the record was both partial and unparseable. Measured
# consequence: `rejected_on_elided` was cited as "identically zero across the whole tree"
# in the evidence that retracted the dr@2.x elision attribution, while the warning that
# accompanies its increment is present on 8-12.5% of the questions in every DR arm of six
# separate batches. A counter that dies with the process reads exactly like an event that
# never happened - the `dr16-salvage-seam-zeroes-itself` shape, one layer earlier.
#
# Three things this deliberately does NOT do:
#
# 1. It does not aggregate into a scalar such as `verify_pass`. By construction the
#    accepted draft nearly always passed - it was accepted either because it passed,
#    because the revision budget ran out, or because a carve-out degraded a reject into a
#    pass. A near-constant field carries no signal. What varies is the FRICTION it took
#    to get there, so each review is recorded on its own line and any aggregate is
#    computed offline, where the definition can change without a rerun.
# 2. It does not reuse the word "verdict". Downstream `traj_scored.jsonl` already has a
#    `verdict` key meaning "the judge marked this answer correct". Two different verdicts
#    under one name is how a label comes to describe something nobody measured.
# 3. It does not let "no records" mean "no rejections". A flow-off anchor never builds
#    this gate at all, so it writes nothing - indistinguishable from a gate that ran and
#    never fired. The `installed` record is the presence flag that separates them; a
#    reader that finds no `installed` line must report "not applicable", not zero.

    "evidence, (2) are sources cited for the key facts, (3) does the draft "
    "actually answer the task. Keep any internal reasoning brief. Deliver the "
    "verdict by calling the review_verdict tool. If you cannot call tools, your "

# The gate was rejecting correct answers because their evidence had aged out of
# the window, not because the answer was wrong. Both recoverable items in one
# 120-question batch died here: a draft committing "Dr. Martens" (gold: Dr
# Martens) and one committing "Last Christmas" (gold: Last Christmas) were each
# failed on every bullet as unsupported, with 87% and 100% of the tool results
# in context already replaced by the elision placeholder. A reviewer that reads
# "the supporting text is gone" as "the claim is unsupported" is testing whether
# evidence is still resident, not whether the answer is true - which biases it
# against exactly the long runs that most need a verdict.
_ELISION_RUBRIC = (

    "means the supporting text was dropped to fit the window - NOT that the "

    "evidence was elided: if the draft cites a URL and the body is no longer in "
    "view, the citation is sufficient, and you may record it in "
    '"unverifiable_elided" instead. Reject only for a claim that contradicts '
    "evidence still in view, or that cites nothing at all. This overrides every "

# The reviewer passed a draft whose scored table carried two order-of-magnitude
# errors, and it was right to by its own rules: _STRICT_REJECT_ONLY tells it not to
# reject a claim it "merely cannot verify either way", and a cell the draft has
# already marked `(est.)` is exactly that shape. So the estimate has to be named as
# the claim rather than as a gap in the evidence.
#
# Unconditional, unlike the two rubrics above. Their knobs exist because a bench arm
# runs the same reviewer and a measured distribution may not move underneath it; this
# module serves one product and no arm, so a knob here could only ever be set one way.
#
# It reads the DRAFT, not the evidence, which is what keeps the elision carve-out from
# swallowing it: a number the draft calls an estimate is an estimate whether or not the
# page it came from is still in the window. Stated in the text as well, because the
# carve-out claims to override "every rule above" and a reader of the assembled prompt
# cannot see which rule was written first.

    "or in a ranking the draft then orders by. Where one does, name that cell in "
    "unsupported_claims AND in estimated_cells: the estimate is the claim, and it was "
    "summed and ranked as though it were measured. The second field is what tells the "
    "gate this rejection reads the draft rather than the evidence. This holds whether or "
    "not the evidence behind the cell is "
    "still in view, because it is a fact about the draft. A quantity the draft computes "
