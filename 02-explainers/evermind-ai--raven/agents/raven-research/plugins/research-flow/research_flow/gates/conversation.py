"""Multi-turn conversation support for DR mode (dr@3.0, product surface only).

Every published DR reading is turn one of a fresh session. The bench harness
sends exactly one message per question, so the second turn of a DR conversation
has never run under measurement - not once across the whole dr@1.0 - dr@3.0
ladder. That is the reason this module exists and also the reason everything in
it is off by default: it is a product feature whose effect size is unknown, and
an unmeasured default-on capability is the shape this repo has paid for most.

Three things happen here.

**1. A turn-level decision about whether the research machine should run.**
The flow's ``enabled`` knob decides turn one. From turn two on, a small classifier
decides, because "mode" is the wrong granularity for a conversation: a follow-up
like "expand the third paragraph" or "thanks" would otherwise pay for the verify
gate, the spin breaker, the fetch floor and a research appendix reporting an empty
trail. The classifier is a fresh two-message conversation sharing
nothing with the turn's context, exactly like the verify reviewer, so it cannot
be steered by the history it is judging.

**What the gate deliberately does NOT touch: the system prompt.** The DR identity
and contract stay byte-identical on every turn of a session even when the turn is
answered from context. The system prompt is the head of the cached prefix, so
varying it per turn re-bills the whole conversation at uncached rates - measured
on this stack at 4.3x when a provider slot silently disabled caching. A gate that
saves one verify call and loses the prefix cache is a net loss. So the gate cuts
*behaviour* (observers, iteration budget, answer shaping) and never *text*.

**Fail-open direction is "research".** A classifier that errors, times out or
returns something unparseable yields a research turn. The two failures are not
symmetric: a needless research turn costs latency and quota, a wrongly skipped
one answers a factual question from stale context and states it with the same
confidence. For a research product the second is the one that must not happen by
accident.

**The iteration cap is deliberately not part of what the gate cuts.** It is an
upper bound, not a spend: a turn that needs no tools ends at iteration one whether
the ceiling above it is 6 or 60. Lowering it for a non-research turn would buy
nothing measurable and would add a way for a mis-classified turn to be cut off
mid-answer, which is the one failure this gate must not manufacture.

**2. A research memo carried across turns.** Turn one's evidence does not survive
in usable form: the persist step truncates every tool result to 16k chars and the
history trimmer then drops whole messages by priority, so by turn three the pages
the answer rests on are gone while the answer's claims remain. The memo is a
compact, deterministic record of what was searched and opened, rebuilt from the
client-side ledger rather than asked of the model - same source as the process
appendix, same reason: a self-report is unverifiable and free to be wrong in the
direction that flatters the turn.

⚠️ **The memo is a different artifact from the process appendix and must stay
one.** ``process_appendix`` states as part of its contract that the model never
sees it, in this turn or as history in the next one, and that anyone who wants it
in the transcript is proposing a different change with a different risk. This is
that different change, so it is a separate object with a separate budget: sources
only, capped, no integrity numbers, no ``citation_grounding_rate``. Feeding the
appendix back to the model would put a metric the model can read into the context
of the turn that produces the next value of it.

**3. Identity scope.** The web tools reset their "already seen this" sets at every
turn boundary, on the stated reasoning that the same query on a later turn is a
re-check rather than a loop. That is right for a benchmark item and wrong for a
conversation about one topic, where turn two re-searches and re-opens turn one's
pages. ``identity_scope="topic"`` keeps the identity sets across turns of a
session. It is not the default because it has a real failure mode - see
``SearchSaturation.reset``.
