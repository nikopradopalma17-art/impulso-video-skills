"""Search-without-fetch pathology guard (DR flow).

DR search results carry titles and links (snippets are stripped by
default; an arm that restores them gets a short selection preview, still
not an answer) — an answer can only be grounded in fetched pages. A turn
that keeps searching without opening one is collecting leads it will
never use. When the streak passes the
floor, a note is appended to the newest tool result (persisted history is
the only train-serve-safe channel), escalating at most ``max_notes``
times per turn.

The streak is counted **since the last fetch**, not since the turn
started. Keying it on "has this turn ever fetched" made the observer
switch itself off for good at the first page opened, which in a
150-iteration turn is almost immediately: the pathology that actually
costs answers is opening a page early and then running twenty more
searches without opening another. Measured on one batch, that shape hit
12 and 13 questions out of 76 per arm and every one of them sat in the
dead zone, while the whole batch emitted a single note.
