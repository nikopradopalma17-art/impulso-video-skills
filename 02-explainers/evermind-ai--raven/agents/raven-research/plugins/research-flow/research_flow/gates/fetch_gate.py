"""Fetch-gate hook: withhold ``web_search`` until a page has been opened.

The decision lives in ``research_flow.support.fetch_gate_core.FetchGate``; this
module is the seam that feeds it tool results and turns its verdict into an
action. Split that way so the rule is testable without an agent loop, and so the
action - removing a tool from one iteration's schema - is the only thing that
needs the loop.

        ★ 20260825: **observation only, deliberately** — same scope as
        ``AskUserGate.before_execute_tools``, which leaves such a call to execute
        "so the model reads the fallback string and goes back to work".

        It exists because this gate's design note claimed that withholding the tool
        makes re-requesting it "not an available move", and that is false:
        ``ToolRegistry.execute`` resolves against the REGISTRY, and
        ``HookDecision.modified_tools`` is scoped to the iteration and never edits
        the registry (``raven.contracts.loop_hooks`` says so). A withheld tool can
        still be named and still runs.

        Worse, before this counter the bypass was **invisible**: ``observe_search``
        counts every ``web_search`` result including bypassed ones, so the streak
        keeps climbing and ``gate_closed_now`` stays True — a fully bypassed turn and
        a fully honoured turn produced identical counters. Observed willingness of
        this model to name un-offered tools on dr@3.4 is low but non-zero (``exec``
        ×9 on base128, a hallucinated ``search`` ×1 on dr128), and a tool that was
        advertised, called 15+ times, then silently withdrawn is an untested
        condition. Whoever enables this knob has to be able to see it.
