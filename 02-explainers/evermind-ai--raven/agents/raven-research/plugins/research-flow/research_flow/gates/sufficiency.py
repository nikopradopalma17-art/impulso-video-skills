"""First-round sufficiency gate (DR flow).

Once a turn has searched and opened a page, an independent context is asked one
question: do these pages already decide the answer? On a yes, a note goes into
history telling the turn to stop opening leads and write; on anything else the
turn continues exactly as it would have.

Two properties are the whole design.

**The gate is judged on retrieved evidence, not on the question.** Every earlier
candidate for "answer the easy ones quickly" gated on the model's prior confidence
about whether it needed to look something up - a triage over the query text in front
of the loop, a prompt clause exempting widely-known facts, a plain-first arm holding
an escalate tool. Those judgments cannot be checked against anything. This one runs
after the contract's grounding floor is already paid, so its input is the pages
themselves.

**The action releases; it does not restrict.** The note is an instruction appended to
the newest tool result - the train-serve-safe channel, same as the budget line - so
the model can disregard it, and the draft it writes still goes through ``verify``,
whose rejection can buy a bounded retrieval round. Removing ``web_search`` instead
would leave a wrong verdict with nothing downstream able to repair it.

Fail-open by contract, toward research: a stalled judge, a transport error, an
unparsed verdict and an insufficient verdict are one outcome as far as the turn is
concerned - nothing is written.

**The listing stage** (``judge_listing``, product-only, off in every measured arm) asks
the same question one round earlier: after the first search and before any page, over
the result snippets. A settled question - a definition, a constant, a capital - is
decided by snippets that agree, and the round it saves is the two page reads the
floor would otherwise demand. It is a second, separately latched judgement, not a
lower floor: an insufficient verdict on the listing leaves the page-floor judgement
exactly as it was, so a research question keeps its release door. Its release
waives contract rule 1 for that reply and says so (``sufficiency_listing_notice``).
