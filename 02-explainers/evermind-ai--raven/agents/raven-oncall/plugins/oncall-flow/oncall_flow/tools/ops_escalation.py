"""The two paths out of an on-call campaign: ask a person, or hand back a finding.

Both exist because the first round of the real-task experiment had neither. The
interruption contract ("only contact a person when not doing so costs at least N
minutes") was written into the task prompt and wired to nothing, so the only route
to a human was the general messaging tool and the threshold was never evaluated
once. The report requirements were likewise prose, so a final report that never
mentioned the baseline it was measured against was accepted -- and without that
one number the reader cannot tell whether training helped, which is the opposite
decision from the one the report implied.

The lesson those two failures share is the one this file exists to apply:
**a guarantee written in a prompt is not a guarantee.** So:

  - ``ops_ask_owner`` runs every interruption through ``ContractGuard``. A refused
    ask does not reach anyone, and the refusal is recorded -- how often the loop
    wanted to breach the contract is a real signal about its judgement, visible
    only because the guard absorbed it instead of the person.
  - ``ops_finish`` runs every report through ``missing_fields``. A report the
    receiver could not act on is refused with the field named, so the loop has to
    supply it rather than be graded down for omitting it.

Both keep their state next to the campaign ledger. A wake turn starts cold from
disk, so a budget held only in memory would be handed back in full on every wake
and there would be no enforcement at all.

Delivery is the one part the port reshapes (D4, and D3 for the conclusion):
the fork reached the owner by taking the host's message tool off the registry
and sending itself; the trunk hands a plugin no registry, so an ALLOWED ask --
and a filed report -- come back to the model as the exact text to send with
the message tool, which the product deliberately keeps enabled. What the guard
guarantees is unchanged and is the half that matters: a REFUSED ask never
reaches anyone, because the refusal happens in the tool. The guard mechanics
themselves (load/save, the question trail) live in ``oncall_flow.escalation``
since part 2a; this file is the two faces over them.
