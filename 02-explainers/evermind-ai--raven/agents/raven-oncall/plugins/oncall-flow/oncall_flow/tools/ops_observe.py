"""Raw-output tools for on-call campaigns: the job's own lines, and its outputs.

Why these exist separately from ``ops_tune_status``. That tool compresses a
trial's progress to a single line (``fetch_progress(tail=2)``, printing only the
last sample), which is enough for a training run whose progress rows each carry
the metric. It is not enough for a solver: measured on a real interFoam job, one
timestep prints 18 lines and only 2 carry the phase-fraction statistics, so a
one-line sample lands on the informative row about one time in nine. An agent
could then observe twenty times and still see almost nothing -- observation count
non-zero, information near zero.

These two tools pass the backend's output through unchanged. They parse nothing,
rank nothing and judge nothing: which lines matter, and whether the numbers in
them are healthy, is the judgement under measurement.
