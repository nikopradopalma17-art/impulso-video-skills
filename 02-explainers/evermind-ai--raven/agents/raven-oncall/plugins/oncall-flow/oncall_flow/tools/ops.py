"""The ops tool faces: drive and inspect a long-running campaign from chat.

The fork's tool file, said through the plugin seams. ``ops_tune_status`` reads
a campaign's ledger (the on-disk source of truth) to report progress and every
recorded fact; ``ops_submit`` runs one round and arranges the wake that reads
it; the rest are the listing, the note, the kill and the re-check faces. What
changed in the port is the wiring, never the face: the campaign root comes
from the factory (``tools.base.ops_home``) instead of host config, scheduling
rides the namespaced wake grant instead of the CronService (``wakes.py``, with
``wake_route`` recorded in the campaign's meta as the D9 rebuilt addressing),
and the decision-basis gate is the 2a mechanism layer (``policy.py``).
``ops_tune_launch`` lives in ``tune_launch.py`` and is deliberately not a
manifest contribution -- the fork kept it off the agent's menu so the model
steers round by round; full-auto stays reachable via ``python -m
oncall_flow.tune`` (D5).

    The unit comes from the declaration and is printed, never interpreted: this
    layer is shared by every domain that runs jobs, and it used to say "GPU
    minutes" to a solver campaign spending core-minutes.

    An undeclared budget says so rather than printing nothing. Silence reads as
    "there was no line about budget", which is indistinguishable from "this
    campaign has no limit" -- and the second is the case where the loop most needs
    to know, since nothing will stop it.

    **The spend is printed, and that is a change.** This line used to carry the
    total alone, on the reasoning that subtracting is the caller's judgement. That
    reasoning holds only if the caller can obtain the spend, and it cannot: what a
    solver log offers is one job's ExecutionTime, which is not the campaign's spend
    once there are several jobs, or a killed one, or a core count. Measured
    2026-08-12 -- a loop derived the spend from ExecutionTime and multiplied by a
    core count its job script silently ignores, read 70.9 core-minutes against a
    true 25.33, and cut the task's endTime in half inside a budget that covered the
    original. Its arithmetic was right; the premise was missing from the only place
    that could supply it.

    What is still left to the caller is the judgement: whether the remainder covers
    finishing. That needs a rate extrapolated from readings, and none of it is here.

    A spend that could not be read says so. A zero would read as "nothing spent
    yet", which is the state a loop acts on most freely.

    Not every budget is machine time, and the ones that are not are answered from
    the campaign's own record rather than from the host -- a watch that ran no
    jobs has spent no compute however long it has been watching, so the host's
