"""Shared ground for the contributed ops tools: home, turn context, scheduling.

Three things every tool face needs and none should own alone:

- **the home.** The fork resolved its campaign root per call from the host
  config (``get_ops_home``); the plugin's root is the launcher-injected
  ``stateRoot`` (else a workspace default), handed to the factories once and
  held here. Module-global like the fork's config was: one activated
  oncall-flow per process, which is the plugin registry's own discipline
  (a duplicate id refuses activation).
- **the turn context.** Which window a call came from (session key), what
  task statement it carries, and where a wake scheduled now should land.
  The fork's loop pushed this per turn (``set_context``); the trunk loop
  pushes nothing, so the part-2c gate hook is the caller -- same face, new
  driver. Until that hook lands, an unnamed call resolves through the task
  tier and the one-live-campaign tier exactly as the fork's did with an
  empty session key.
- **the scheduling verb.** Every wake goes through the wake grant
  (``wakes.schedule_next_look``), and every schedule that knows a live route
  records it as ``wake_route`` in the campaign's meta -- these tools are the
  route's first writer; the resident watcher is its reader (2a design).
  A turn whose channel is the scheduler's own ("cron") is a cold start, not
  a window: its route comes from the campaign's declaration, never from the
  turn (the fork stored per-window addressing in the cron payload; the seam
  ruling retired that store).
