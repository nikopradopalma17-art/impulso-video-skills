"""OpsDeclareTool: write a campaign's declaration, once, before anything runs.

``meta.json`` has always been this declaration -- what the target is, which
machine and which case the work runs on, how a trial starts, what the budget is,
where it starts from -- and the apparatus gate already refuses a submit if it
changes. What was missing was the front door: every campaign here was set up by
hand, so an agent given a task and a path had nowhere to record what it worked
out. Measured 2026-08-18: an arm chose the right machine, read the owner's run
script, and then submitted with an empty address and a container image that held
none of the owner's software, because ``ops_submit`` had no field for any of it.

Splitting this out of ``ops_submit`` is what keeps that tool from growing: of its
twenty parameters, sixteen were read once at round 0 and overridden from the
campaign on every round after. It also puts a gap between deciding how to run and
spending the first minute of compute -- which is where the owner gets to look.
