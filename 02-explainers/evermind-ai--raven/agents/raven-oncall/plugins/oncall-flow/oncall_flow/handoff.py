"""Reporting upward to the orchestrating agent, and a receiver that scores it.

An on-call loop has two escalation paths and they are not the same capability.
Reaching a person spends trust and has to be rare; handing back to the
orchestrating agent costs a message and should be routine. What the two share is
the failure that makes escalating pointless: a report the receiver cannot act on
without going and looking itself.

For a person, "enough to act on" is a judgement and needs an eval set. For a
program it is a schema, which is the whole reason this path is worth building
separately: the hardest half of the metric collapses into an invariant that
either holds or is a bug. What is left needing judgement is only *when* to
report.

Two constraints from the product shape are enforced here rather than graded:

  - **the loop suggests, it does not dispatch.** Which atomic agent runs next is
    the orchestrator's decision. A report that names an action to take is
    accepted; one that claims to have taken it is rejected.
  - **one signal, one report.** The dedupe key is the loop's own statement of
    what this report is about, so the receiver can reject the second copy
    instead of trusting the loop to have remembered.
