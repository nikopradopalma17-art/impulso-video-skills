"""Bare-process backend for OpenFOAM jobs, with core-hour accounting.

Why this is separate from ``ProcessExecutor`` rather than a change to it: that
class prices work in GPU minutes for a campaign that is mid-analysis, and a CFD
job is priced in core-hours. Sharing the launcher and the idempotent submit while
overriding only the measurement keeps the two cost models from colliding.

Three things differ from a training job, all of them because OpenFOAM keeps its
own books and none of ours:

  - **cost is cores x wall clock, not wall clock.** Without the core factor a
    24-core run and a 1-core run of the same duration cost the same, so the loop
    could buy speed by raising ``numberOfSubdomains`` and never pay for it.
  - **there is no ``progress.jsonl``.** The spend of a killed job is recovered
    from what the solver itself left: the last ``ClockTime = N s`` it printed, and
    the mtimes of its log and time directories. Counting a killed job as zero
    refunds exactly the compute a cancel-and-resubmit loop would burn.
  - **there is no ``result.json``.** A finished solver prints ``End``; that, not a
    file we invented, is what says the process ran to completion. Note this is a
    statement about the process, not about the physics -- whether the answer is
    usable is the reader's judgement and stays out of here.
