"""What the harness itself knows about the world, so a claim about it can be checked.

The failure this exists for: an on-call loop wrote that
``keep_recent_checkpoints=3`` meant only the three most recent checkpoints were
kept and the best one had probably already been discarded. It was wrong, and it
had not looked. ``action_log`` catches a claim about an *action* the loop says it
took; ``_comparative_words`` catches a claim that is *relative* while declaring
itself absolute. Neither catches a claim about the *state of the world*, which is
the class the loop got wrong.

Three decisions carry this file:

  - **only state the harness already holds.** Budget, job status and the
    checkpoint listing are things the tool layer probes anyway. Anything else --
    what the loss curve means, whether the run is converging, which checkpoint is
    best -- is not here and must not be added: computing "which is best" for the
    loop is the comparison the loop is being scored on.
  - **refuse on contradiction, never on uncertainty.** A hedged claim is still
    checked (the round-1 claim was hedged, and its factual half was false), but a
    claim is only refused when the facts say otherwise. No facts means no
    refusal.
  - **misses are counted, not hidden.** Every family reports what it saw and
    could not resolve, because a heuristic that silently drops what it cannot
    parse is the bug this line has already hit repeatedly.

**What this deliberately does not catch** -- read this before trusting a pass:

  - English only. A narrative in any other language passes every check here.
  - Only the three families below. A false claim about GPU memory, dataset size,
    learning rate, wall-clock, or anything else the harness does not probe is
    invisible.
  - A claim with no number and no identifier ("some checkpoints were dropped",
    "the budget is nearly gone") is counted as unresolved and passes.
  - "The best checkpoint was discarded" with no step id cannot be resolved:
    knowing which one was best is a comparison this module is not allowed to
    make. It is counted as unresolved and passes.
  - Paraphrase outside the word lists passes. The lists can only add refusals.
  - The facts themselves are a snapshot taken when the tool layer last probed.
    A claim that was true at probe time and false now (or the reverse) is judged
    against the snapshot, and ``observed_at_ms`` is what says how stale that is.
