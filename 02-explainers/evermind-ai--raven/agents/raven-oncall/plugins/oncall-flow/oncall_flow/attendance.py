"""How much of a watch has been kept: looks taken, wakes armed, time open.

Two separate needs read the same three numbers, which is why they are counted in
one place.

A budget metered off the machine (``budget.WALL_CLOCK``, ``budget.LOOKS``) has
nowhere else to get its spend: the host measures machine time, and a campaign
watching a price feed spends none of it. The reading has to come from the
campaign's own record.

And a delivered watch has to say how many times it looked. What the report gate
already requires is that the conclusion be checkable -- ``observed`` states what
was seen, ``baseline`` what it started from -- but for a campaign whose correct
outcome was to do nothing, those are equally satisfied by having watched
diligently and by never having looked at all. The count is the only thing that
separates them, and it is not the loop's to state: it is in the trail either way,
so it is read from there and attached (measured on SentinelBench: 20 of 100 tasks
have "stay silent" as the right answer).

Nothing here is a judgement. Whether twelve looks over four hours was attentive
enough depends on what was being watched, and that belongs to whoever reads the
report.
