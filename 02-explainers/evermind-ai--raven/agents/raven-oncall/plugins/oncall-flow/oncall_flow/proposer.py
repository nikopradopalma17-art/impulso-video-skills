"""Proposers: decide which trial configs to run next.

A proposer turns the campaign's results so far into the next batch of trials.
``GridProposer`` is mechanical (a fixed grid, proposed once). ``LLMProposer``
delegates the judgment -- reading the score surface and proposing where to look
next -- to a language model through an injected ``complete(prompt) -> text``
callable, so the proposer is unit-testable with a fake model and, in production,
wired to Raven's configured provider. The LLM only *proposes* configs; scoring
stays deterministic in the trial, keeping the reward verifiable.
