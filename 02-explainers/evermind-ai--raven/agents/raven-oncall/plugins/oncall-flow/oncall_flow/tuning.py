"""Adaptive tuning loop: let a proposer drive a campaign round by round.

Each round asks the proposer for the next batch of trials given the results so
far, runs them on the campaign's backend, and repeats until the proposer stops
(returns []), no new trials are added, or the round cap is hit. The proposer may
be mechanical (a grid) or LLM-driven; either way scoring stays deterministic in
the trial, so the reward remains verifiable.
