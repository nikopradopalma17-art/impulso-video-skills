"""Compute-job backends for the Ops orchestration loop.

Import the ``JobBackend`` interface from here; concrete backends
(``MockJobBackend`` for tests and fault-injection eval, ``VolcJobBackend``
for VolcEngine ML Platform custom tasks) live in sibling modules and are
never imported directly by orchestration code, so the loop stays decoupled
from any single compute provider.

A *job* here is one unit of long-lived external compute (a tuning trial, a
training run, a simulation) submitted to a backend and run asynchronously.
This is distinct from a proactive *cron job* (a scheduled turn) — see
``raven/proactive_engine``.
