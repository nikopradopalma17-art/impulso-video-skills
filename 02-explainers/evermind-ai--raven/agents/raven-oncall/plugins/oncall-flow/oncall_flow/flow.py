"""The turn-frame hook: the fork's loop-side on-call glue on the trunk's six phases.

The fork hard-wired four behaviours into its AgentLoop; each is one axis here,
an ``AgentHook`` on the v3 surface (raven/contracts/loop_hooks.py), and the
plugin contributes them as ONE hook running them in a fixed order:

- **turn context** (fork ``_set_tool_context`` + ``_capture_owner_instruction``,
  loop/main.py): window identity and the task fingerprint reach the tool faces
  through ``tools.base`` -- the same instances the loop registered, met through
  the roster -- and what the owner types lands in the watched campaign's notes,
  pulling the pending wake to now when a question was waiting on it.
- **turn accounting** (fork ``TurnOutcome.usage_totals``): the turn's summed
  LLM usage, counted per iteration and stamped into the persisted record
  through ``metadata["observers"]`` at the send fire.
- **the work-to-watch judgement** (fork ``_note_watched_path`` + ops/watched.py):
  one sidecar model call per turn that touches a subject, the verdict cached on
  the turn's participant instance, and the provenance line delivered where a
  failure would be -- on the tool result, via the ``append_note`` grant, the
  only channel measured to change behaviour.
- **the turn close** (fork ``Tool.ends_turn`` on ops_check_later): a successful
  ops_check_later ends the turn; the fork's primitive does not exist on the
  trunk, so the close is the participant's ``End`` verdict, keyed on the call's
  name plus its result's own first words ("Scheduled a wake" -- every refusal
  branch deliberately starts otherwise).

The judgements (work-to-watch, the cap-kill note, the close) are one
``OncallParticipant`` -- one instance per turn, seated in the axis order through
``ParticipantHook`` -- so the verdict cache and the counters they file are
attributes that die with the turn. The two mechanism axes (context,
accounting) stay hooks: their state rides the turn's ONE metadata dict
(seeded at the inbound fire, same dict through the iterations and the send --
the trunk pins this) under the freight keys below, and ``after_send`` pops
every key, so nothing can leak into a later turn even on a host that skips a
phase. The participant's counters reach the same ``observers`` stamp through its
``archive`` verb, merged after the accounting axis wrote the stamp.

The axes are composed here rather than as manifest rows because the
registry serves hook names sorted, and the axis order is part of this flow's
contract (context before anything that reads it; accounting before the close
so the closing call is counted). ``_run_phase``
mirrors the kernel CompositeHook's documented semantics: first halting state
wins and carries the trail, notes chain in order joined by a blank line, a
raising axis is logged and treated as a no-op.

      campaign (asking again would tell a loop that is driving a campaign to go
      and declare one) and without a provider (the judge rides the lent model,
      never the acting turn's own budget). A judgement that cannot be made
      leaves the look exactly as it would have been -- the fork's asymmetry: a
      missing line costs nothing today, a wrong line is one sentence that does
      not apply. The verdict is cached on ``self`` whatever it says: "not
      watched" is as much an answer as "watched", and the fork paid for exactly
      one judgement per turn.
    * **the cap kill** (measured 2026-09-02 on the fork): a bare "Timed out
      after 600s" reads as a fault to retry -- a nine-minute training run was
      killed at the cap, the result died with it, and the loop re-ran the same
      command into the same wall. The kill is a routing signal, and the note
      names the door this plugin itself contributes. Said as a note under the
      result rather than a rewrite of it: the result belongs to the trunk's
      exec tool, and ``advise`` is the participant's grant for exactly this line.
    * **the turn close** (fork ``Tool.ends_turn``): a successful ops_check_later
      means the next decision belongs to the wake it scheduled; the fork took
      the tools away and let the model write one closing reply, the rebuilt
      shape ends the turn on the wake note itself -- the verdict judged the two
      behaviourally equivalent, and the note already says everything the turn
      decided (when it comes back, and why).

    Both notes answer the finished iteration, so ``advise`` speaks only when
    ``step.response`` is set; the close waits for ``step.tools_ran`` because it
    reads the ops_check_later result out of the transcript. On a closing
    iteration the notes are not asked for -- the composite dropped them with the
    short circuit before this class existed, and the adapter's order keeps that.
