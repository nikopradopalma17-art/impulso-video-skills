"""What a campaign is allowed to DO, written down before it does any of it.

A campaign could start a trial and nothing else. That is enough while the work is
a parameter sweep, where every round is the same command with different numbers.
It is not enough for a campaign that watches: when the condition it was waiting
for holds, something has to happen -- place the order, apply for the posting,
raise the alert -- and none of that is a trial.

Two properties make this a declared table rather than a command composed at the
moment of acting.

**It is a permission list.** The declaration is written once, before anything
runs, and read back to the owner. An action that is not in it cannot be taken. A
loop that assembled the order line each time it woke could put ``sell`` where it
had said ``buy`` and nothing would be standing between that and the broker.

**Repeating is not always harmless, and only the declaration knows which.**
Marking a thread read twice leaves it read; buying three shares twice leaves six.
So each action says which it is, and the harmful ones are keyed in the ledger by
what they were asked to do -- a wake that comes back after the acting turn died
finds the record and does not do it again. This is the same guarantee trials have
always had, and the reason an action does not go through ``exec``: exec keeps no
record, so the second wake cannot tell that the first one already acted.

What this module does not do is decide when. That is the loop's judgement, and it
is the whole thing being measured.
