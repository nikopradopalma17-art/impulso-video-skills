"""ProcessExecutor: run each job as a detached process on a remote host.

Docker is the wrong shape for GPU training on these machines. The model and data
live on a network mount, the driver stack belongs to the host, and the job is a
bare ``python3`` invocation -- containerising it would mean building an image to
wrap a command that already runs. So this backend launches the command with
``nohup``, records its pid, and decides terminality from the pid plus the durable
``result.json`` the job writes -- or, for a job that exits without writing one
(an upstream program has never heard of this contract), the one its launcher
synthesizes from the exit code on the way out.

Two things it does that a plain launcher would not:

**It enforces a compute budget across the whole campaign.** The budget is a
property of the experiment, not of any one run, and a loop that may restart could
otherwise buy itself more compute by asking for a longer run each time. Spend is
summed from every job's own ``result.json`` (plus the elapsed time of anything
still running) and the remainder is written into the config, overriding whatever
the caller asked for. When it reaches zero, ``submit`` refuses.

**It measures detection latency on the host clock only.** The instant a job became
terminal is the mtime of its ``result.json``; the host's current time is read in
the same command, and the subtraction happens entirely in host time. A clock skew
of seconds between the loop's machine and the host would otherwise corrupt every
latency silently.
