"""Backend resolution from campaign state -- the tool layer's extension seam.

A campaign's ``meta.json`` names the backend its jobs run on; this maps that name
to a factory, so the tools never hardcode one. Docker over SSH is built in and
stays the default (a campaign written before this seam existed has no ``backend``
key and still resolves). Two kinds of client plug in here:

  - **execution adapters** -- a Slurm/cloud backend (SkyPilot) becomes a factory
    registration, not a change to every tool;
  - **bare processes** -- GPU training on a shared host is a plain command, not a
    container: the model and data sit on a network mount and the driver stack
    belongs to the host, so wrapping it in an image would only wrap a command
    that already runs.

Connection-name resolution (a campaign that names an owner-registered machine
instead of carrying an address) stays a seam: the trunk connections module is
deliberately not a contracts paper (verdict feature 13 / C2), so the plugin
carries its own read-only reader over the same store
(``oncall_flow.connections``, the seam-ruling shape) and that reader is the
default resolver here. A host may still install a different one with
:func:`set_connection_resolver` -- the part-2a seam, kept -- and installing
``None`` restores the default rather than disabling resolution.
