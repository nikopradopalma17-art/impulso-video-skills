"""How a machine is reached, so nothing above this has to know.

A machine the owner registered is not always a different computer. Someone who
writes their own solver usually runs it where they wrote it and installs raven on
that same box: there is no host to reach and no key to present, and a command is
simply run. Measured need, 2026-08-18 -- the CFD group's in-house Fortran code
lives on the machine raven would be installed on.

Everything above this seam names a machine and nothing else. Which runner answers
is a property of the connection, so a campaign, a tool call and a task statement
all read the same whether the work runs across the room or in this process's own
filesystem.
