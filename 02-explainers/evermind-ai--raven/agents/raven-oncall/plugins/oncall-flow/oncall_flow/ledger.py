"""Durable job ledger for the Ops orchestration loop.

The ledger is the on-disk source of truth for what the loop is doing: for each
job (keyed by its idempotency key) it records the backend handle, current
status, and terminal result. After a crash the loop reopens the ledger and
resumes from it — re-driving ``submit`` only for jobs that never got a handle,
and never re-running a job already recorded terminal. Every mutation is
persisted atomically (temp file + ``os.replace``), and both the temp file and
its directory are fsynced before the rename is considered done: the rename
alone survives ``kill -9`` but not a host that loses power, which can leave the
new name pointing at unflushed bytes.

If the file is unreadable anyway, opening raises ``LedgerCorruptError`` rather
than starting from an empty ledger. Starting empty would lose the record of
which jobs already finished, and the loop would resubmit them -- for an on-call
loop whose jobs are expensive and sometimes irreversible, refusing to start is
the safer failure, and it is loud.
