/* What a model can do, as glyphs a terminal can actually draw.
 *
 * The web picker hangs a tooltip off an icon; a terminal has nowhere to put
 * one, so the glyphs come with a legend built from the rows on screen. Only
 * the tags actually present are explained -- a fixed legend of thirteen
 * symbols would be longer than the list it annotates, and most providers use
 * five of them.
 *
 * Every glyph is a single-width BMP symbol with no emoji presentation. The
 * brand mark aside, this file is read on terminals that render an emoji two
 * cells wide and misalign the whole column, so nothing here reaches for one.
 *
 * Input and output modalities are deliberately not drawn: each one beyond text
 * is already a capability (image in is `image-recognition`, image out is
 * `image-generation`), so a second row of glyphs would restate the first.
