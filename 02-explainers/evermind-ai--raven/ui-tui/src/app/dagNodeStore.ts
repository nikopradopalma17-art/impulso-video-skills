/**
 * `settled` is the word that a node can never change again: either `dag.node`
 * reported a status other than `pending`/`running`, or its read failed
 * `DAG_TRACE_READ_FAILURE_CAP` times in a row. It is recorded here, not just
 * read off the live poll target, because it has to survive the poll's effect
 * rearming, which a closure-local flag would not.
 *
 * `failures` is the consecutive-read-failure count backing that cap, kept
 * here for the same reason: the poll increments and persists it on every
 * failed read and resets it to zero on every successful one, so a streak
 * already partway to the cap is still there after the effect rearms.
