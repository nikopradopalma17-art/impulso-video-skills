// `/dag` — the user-initiated half of the DAG surface.
//
// The live `dag.*` events cover a run that behaves. Two things they cannot do:
//
//   * repair a graph whose frames were lost. Nothing replays them, so a gateway
//     that restarted mid-run leaves nodes pinned to `running` forever. `dag.get`
//     re-reads the run dir, where the instance registry supplies the progress
//     the events did not deliver.
//   * show a node's rendered prompt or its output. No event carries either: the
//     manifest inlines only the leaf nodes' text, and the tool result kept in
//     the transcript is clamped to 200 chars.
//   * name the nodes. `run_subagent_dag`'s own call label elides past the third
//     id, and a graph row carries its id only in the block a click opens. The
//     graph prints a short ordinal in every box and at the head of every row and
//     this command takes one, so the ids are reachable without a mouse; the
//     refresh listing prints the ordinal-to-id mapping for anyone who wants it.
//
// Both are user-initiated for a reason: the terminal event handlers are
// synchronous (the turn commits its transcript row inside them), so an RPC
// round-trip cannot be awaited there without reordering the event stream.

 * reach history, `live` may repeat it -- genuinely mid-turn, or appended

 * resumed transcript renders lives on `tool.dag` in history instead, and a
 * mutation there would not re-render: `MessageLine`/`EpisodeMessage` are
 * memoized on the `msg` prop's identity, so a fresh reference has to reach all
 * the way from the top-level array down to the one tool that changed. Every
 * message, episode and tool the refresh does not touch keeps its existing
 * reference, which is what lets the rest of the transcript skip re-rendering.
