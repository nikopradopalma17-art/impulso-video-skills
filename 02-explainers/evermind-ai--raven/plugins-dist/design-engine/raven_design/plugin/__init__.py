"""Factories the manifest names: the turn-frame hook and three design tools.

The registry calls one factory per contribution, each with its own
``PluginContext``, so the tools and the hook cannot be handed to each other
directly. A per-activation :class:`_Shared` bridges them (the sibling product
plugins' shape): whichever factory runs first parses the slice once, builds
the selector once (fail-closed over the packaged corpus), and caches one
:class:`~raven_design.rendering.service.RenderService` per working directory
-- the pooled loop serves many sessions, and a render service is bound to one
workspace by its path policy, so the seat is per-workdir (the ppt engine's
SessionTool insight).

Admission is the D6 shape: an absent or false ``enabled`` in
``plugins.config["design-engine"]`` means no surface is cast at all. The
render tools additionally decline when the ``render`` extra is not installed
(playwright / pymupdf / pypdfium2 -- the fork assembly's returns-[] contract,
said as plugin admission), and the task-state surfaces decline without a
``taskState.stateRoot`` (state written to a guessed path is state a reinstall
silently abandons). A slice that does not PARSE is neither on nor off: the
parse error is caught here, every tool factory declines, and ``make_hook``
casts the fail-closed :class:`~raven_design.plugin.hook.MisconfiguredEngineHook`
-- every turn answers with the config fix named until someone repairs the
slice (the code-flow MisconfiguredGate doctrine, w101).
