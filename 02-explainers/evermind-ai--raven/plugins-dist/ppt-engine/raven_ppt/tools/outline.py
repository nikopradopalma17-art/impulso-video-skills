"""`ppt_outline`: decide what the deck argues, before drawing any of it.

The stage the route was missing. An author went from the materials straight to a
python-pptx program, so what each page said got decided while its geometry was being
typed -- and the decks were thin, eight pages of a title and three short lines, with
nothing having asked what the audience must believe by the end.

Deciding that is the author's, not this tool's. What this tool does is bind it and
check what can be checked here, a whole build-and-measure cycle earlier than the same
thing would be caught after a build: a figure that is not in the catalogue, a page
count the brief did not agree, and -- with a template bound -- structural pages that
do not name the template's own. It once also checked a number against an index of
what the materials state; that gate was deleted (design doc D3a: ten findings across
seven runs, all ten false), and no stage builds such an index now.

And it is where gathering belongs. A page that names what it lacks becomes a search
here, at the one moment when what the deck is missing is actually known --
`ppt_prepare` has to guess it before anything knows what the pages are.

    when ingest extracts nothing; in a live run the errand was sent, sat in the job's

    no figures, which is a count; the materials cite URLs, which is a count. A deck
    whose materials cite nothing is not held, and a deck that has figures is not held,

# 17 of 17, each with a line in `needs` saying an example would have cost more to adapt
# than to redraw. The ask that listed those pages had been read twice and changed
# nothing, so the share is a refusal now. A quarter rather than a third: the deck read as
# the template's composed 3 of 17 (18%); a later one composed 6 of 17 (35%) and its six
# composed pages -- two tables, a card grid, a flow row, a timeline, a risk grid -- were

# live runs. A 14-page run put 8 of its 11 content pages on one prototype (73%) and its

# repeated prototype from 6 to 5 between the two calls and kept the eight. Two 16-page
# runs put at most 2 of their 14 content pages on one prototype (14%), and a 12-page run

    A refusal. It was a warning for one revision, on the argument that a uniform deck is
    a thing a user can ask for and that refusing would trap a run told to repeat a layout.
    What settled it is that no run has asked: three plans on briefs carrying no layout
    instruction came out at 8 of 11, 5 of 9 and 10 of 10 content pages on one prototype,
    the last with 26 of the template's 27 examples untouched, and each was corrected
    within a minute of being refused. A warning would have filed all three as proposed.
    The refusal names a page to move each repeat to, which is what keeps it a gate the
    author can act on rather than a wall. A consecutive run of `SERIES_RUN` or more on
    one example is a series and its pages are not counted: a comparison a reader makes across pages is the
    one deck this would otherwise have no way to plan, since the escape the message
    offers for it is a sentence and not a switch.

    Only the case where one example starts more of the deck than every other page put together;
    a template with fewer examples than the deck has pages has to repeat one, and that is not refused.
    Only when this template's own unused examples can carry the pages that repeat, which
    is what keeps a template with two body layouts out of it -- there the repetition is
    the template's doing, and the borrow offer, which stays an offer, is the only answer.

    Measured after the fact: the run this was written against never reached it. Once the
    `ppt_template` roster stopped being dropped in transit, one plan came out on 10
    distinct prototypes over 14 pages with its most-used one starting 2, so the thing that
    produced variety was the author being told what the template ships. This check is the
