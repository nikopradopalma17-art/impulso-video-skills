"""`ppt_brief`: record what the deck is for, before anything is drawn.

Three things the materials cannot answer, because the answer is not in them: what
language the audience reads, who they are and on what occasion, and how long the
talk is. A paper is written in English and presented in Chinese; the same results
are a fifteen-minute conference talk or a five-minute internal update; and a page
budget comes from the room, not the paper.

The tool records rather than asks, and that division is deliberate. Where there is
a user to ask, `ask_user` is how you ask them -- one question, three parts -- and
this is where the answer lands. Where there is no user (a scripted run, a batch),
the task text usually says, and an author reading "16-20 slides" out of the brief
it was handed is doing the right thing. What is not acceptable is silence: the
build refuses until a brief exists, because a decision confirmed with a user and
then ignored is worse than never having asked.

Everything recorded here binds something. The page budget is checked against the
built deck, the language against what the pages actually say, and whatever the user
ruled out is quoted back by `ppt_build` on every build -- a prohibition agreed here
and then not repeated is one nothing is holding by the time the pages are drawn. The
audience binds differently: it is not re-quoted per build, it is what the brief the
deck is written against says the deck is for. A field that could not be checked would
have no business being confirmed with a user.
