"""`ppt_figure_inspect`: look at a figure before placing it.

The one stage route A declared and never had. `ppt_ingest` returns figure ids and
the caption each one carries in its source, which is enough to cite one correctly
and not enough to place one: an author choosing `fig_3` is choosing something it
has never seen. It cannot tell a legible plot from a scanned blur, a figure from a
logo that happened to survive extraction, or a two-panel composite from a single
chart -- and each of those is a page that has to be rebuilt once somebody looks.

So this hands over the pixels, with the three things the catalogue knows that a
render does not say: the label the *source* gave it, the concerns the ingest
recorded while extracting it, and its native size -- from which the width beyond
which it softens follows, which is the one number that decides whether a figure
can carry a page or has to sit beside the copy.

And it looks, at every figure it is asked about. The look used to be the means to
one end -- a caption for a figure whose source printed none -- so a figure that
arrived captioned was handed over unseen, and the whole catalogue of a captioned
paper went to the author with nothing having read a single pixel of it. A source
caption is a claim about the figure the source drew, not about the file the
extraction produced: a render that lost its top edge arrives under the caption of
the whole one, which makes the caption the last field that should decide whether
anybody looks.

Two products, then, and each one owed on its own terms. A single field deciding a
call that produces two things has now been wrong twice -- the source caption
first, and then the stored review, which skipped the figure whose caption a
malformed reply had already cost it. Neither is a better condition than the other;
the mistake was having one at all.
