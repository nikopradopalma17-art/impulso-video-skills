"""Generate a slide image and make it a figure of this deck immediately.

The generation itself is the host's: this tool rides ``image_generate``'s
transport (``raven.agent.tools.media_gen``), so whichever image model, base
and key the deployment configured under ``tools.media.image`` -- a gpt-image
deployment behind OpenRouter, a chat-routed model such as Nano Banana, an
OpenAI-compatible gateway -- serves the deck too, the spend is recorded where
the host records it, and a Settings edit lands on the next call. What is the
deck's own is everything around the call: the cut-out on a green screen and
its keying, the file the picture lands under, the figure that comes out the
other end.

The file name is the caller's, and every call generates into it, overwriting
what the last ask left there. Nothing is answered from disk: the ask this tool
exists for is "that picture is not what I wanted, do it again", and it arrives
carrying the same words as the ask before it, so a name-keyed cache handed back
the very picture that had just been rejected. Overwriting the name is also what
keeps the re-ask cheap for the page: the program already names that file, so
the second picture reaches the deck with no edit to the script.
