"""`ppt_review`: a second reader looks at the built pages and lists what is wrong.

Every other check on this route is measured -- a number off the file or the render,
reported by a gate. This one is a reading, and it exists because the measured half
cannot reach the largest class of defect a delivered deck still carries. Three runs
delivered pages with a colour bar over the lower half, cards holding three lines in
a region twice their content, a figure at a third of the width its band offered, and
not one card carrying a mark; the gates reported some of it as warnings and the
author, having written those pages itself, accepted every one.

That is the reason this is a separate call and not more text in the build reply. The
author is reviewing its own work with the whole history of writing it in context: a
region it deliberately filled reads to it as a decision already made, and a warning
against a decision is a warning it has already answered. The reviewer here starts
empty -- one page, its plan, and the requirements -- so a void is a void.

It refuses nothing and blocks nothing. What comes back is a list, and which of it to
act on is the author's, the same standing the measured warnings have.
