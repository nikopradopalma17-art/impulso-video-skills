"""`ppt_prepare`: hand over the task, get back a project ready to build in.

The first call of the route, and the only one that reads the user's own words. A
deck task arrives as a sentence -- sometimes carrying everything ("给投资人做一份
15 页中文路演,材料在 ./papers"), sometimes almost nothing -- and everything after
this point works from files rather than from that sentence, so this is where it
gets read.

What comes back is what was *done* plus what is left: the questions only the user
can answer, and the material still to be fetched. Not a verdict on whether the
deck can be made -- that question has one answer on a first pass and costs a model
call to produce it.
