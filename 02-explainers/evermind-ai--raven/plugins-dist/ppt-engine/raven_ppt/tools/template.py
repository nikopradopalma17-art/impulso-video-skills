"""`ppt_template`: build inside the template the user gave us.

What a template is for turned out to be two different things, and treating them as
one produced the decks that got sent back.

A template's **structural pages** -- its cover, its contents list, its section
divider, its closing -- are the pages a reader recognises the house by, and they
are cloned. A deck that draws its own cover announces itself as not the user's
before a word of it is read.

Its **content pages** are examples, not immutable forms. A review deck may clone the
nearest one, replace its words and pictures, delete unused repeated units, and move
or resize the surviving regions when the actual content needs it. A six-card grid
filled with four must remove the two spare units; a portrait picture frame receiving
a landscape figure must be replaced, reshaped, or abandoned. If the page cannot
carry the argument after those edits, the author composes inside the measured house
style instead. The template supplies continuity; the content decides the final
composition.
