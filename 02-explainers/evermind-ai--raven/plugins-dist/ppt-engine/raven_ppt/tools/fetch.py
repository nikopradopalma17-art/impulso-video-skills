"""`ppt_fetch`: bring something from the web into the deck's own materials.

Search finds things; this is what makes one of them usable. Without it a deck can
only be built from files a human already put on disk, which is fine for a paper and
not fine for "make me a deck about X" -- the author can read a page with web_fetch
and then has nowhere to put the figure it found on it.

Where a download lands is decided here rather than asked for, and that is the
point: a document or an image goes into the materials directory, so the next
`ppt_ingest` reads it like any other source and its figures and numbers enter the
fact index. A `.pptx` goes to the project's template slot instead, because a deck
is not a source to quote -- it is a house style to work inside.

The format is decided by looking at the bytes, not by trusting the server. A URL
ending in `.png` that returns HTML, or a `Content-Type: image/png` on a 40MB video,
are both ordinary on the open web; writing either into the materials directory
would fail later somewhere that reads like a bug in the ingest.

A picture's caption comes in with it. Nothing here can see the page a picture sits
on -- the words beside it are in the HTML, not in the bytes -- so the caption is a
parameter, and the author who just read that page with web_fetch is the only thing
holding both. Without it every web figure reached the catalogue with `caption: null`
while a paper's figure arrived with the line printed under it, and a deck given a
marketing banner and no source words captioned it as an architecture diagram.
