"""Reading a tool's arguments as the model actually sends them.

One failure, twice in one run, is why this exists. `ppt_outline` declares `pages` as
an array of objects; a live model sent the array JSON-encoded *inside a string*:

    {"project": "…", "takeaway": "…", "pages": "[{\\"page\\":1,\\"claim\\":\\"…\\"}]"}

The tool iterated the string, called `.get` on a character, and the author got back
`AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` -- a Python traceback where a
sentence should have been. It sent the same shape again, so two of its calls bought
nothing.

The same double-encoding then arrived with a quote inside it -- a claim that quoted
a phrase -- and `Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 919` was all the author got
back for a twelve-page outline. A hand-written JSON string breaks the same way
wherever it is written, so the repairs `_reply` already made for a model's replies
are the repairs applied here, rather than a second set that drifts from them.

Both halves of that are fixed here and neither is a schema change. A double-encoded
array is unambiguous, so it is decoded rather than refused: nothing else could have
been meant, and refusing costs a round to teach the model something the tool could
simply read. What genuinely is the wrong shape gets a sentence naming the shape
wanted, which is what a refusal is for.
