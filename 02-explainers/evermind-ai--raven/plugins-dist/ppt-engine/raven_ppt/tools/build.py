"""`ppt_build`: run the author's program, then show it every page it made.

The tool is thin on purpose -- schema, argument adaptation, the reply -- because
everything it does is somewhere else: the backend runs the program, the gates
measure the file, publication delivers it or refuses. What lives here is the one
thing a tool owns, which is what the model sees coming back -- and on this route
that reply *is* the review: the renders come back to whoever wrote the program,
which is the only actor that can act on all of what they show.

That turns out to matter more than it sounds. The predecessor returned twelve
unlabelled page renders and a JSON blob, and the model could not reliably say
which page it was talking about; it voiced one problem when two stood, and a run
spent seven rebuilds re-checking numbers because the fact ask was the only
instruction it got while seventeen colour bars stood untouched.

# on a reading re-armed it, every time. Measured on a fifteen-page run: two readings,
# about thirty reader calls (one per page, each carrying that page's render), opinions
# on eleven of fifteen pages, fifty edits after the first build, and 72 percent of a
# 63-minute run spent with the model writing. Two is what the reading is worth: the
