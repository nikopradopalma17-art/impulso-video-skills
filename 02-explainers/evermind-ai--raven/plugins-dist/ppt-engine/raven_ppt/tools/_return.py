"""The one place a deck tool's reply is built.

The predecessor had five. `_ok()` existed, and four tools bypassed it to write
`"ok": True` into a dict by hand -- one of them computing it twice in the same
method -- so `ok: false` did not reliably carry an `error` key and a consumer
branching on `error` reached a different conclusion from one branching on `ok`.
A second near-duplicate assembled the render attachments, differing from the
first only in taking a dict where the other took the same dict re-parsed from
its own JSON.

Two rules follow from the upstream tool contract and are enforced here rather
than remembered:

`model_text` stands alone. Blocks are additive, and only providers that can
carry an image inside a `role="tool"` message ever see them -- everything else
(the sentinel, subagents, the curator, session export, any Chat Completions
transport) gets the text. So the text names the file paths and the numbers, and
never says "see the image above".

Every ask, every time. Voicing one problem when two stand reads as the only
thing wrong with the deck: one run kept re-checking numbers for seven rebuilds
because the fact ask was the only instruction it got while seventeen colour bars
stood untouched.
