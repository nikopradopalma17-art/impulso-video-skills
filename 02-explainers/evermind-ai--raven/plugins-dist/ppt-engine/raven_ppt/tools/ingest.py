"""`ppt_ingest`: read the materials once, and say what is in them.

Everything downstream stands on this call. The citation gate can only catch a page
citing Figure 4 while showing Figure 5 if the captions were extracted, and an author
can only quote a figure it was given the text of.
So the reply's job is to make the deck's evidence *addressable* -- every asset by
id, with the label the source gave it -- rather than to describe the reading.
