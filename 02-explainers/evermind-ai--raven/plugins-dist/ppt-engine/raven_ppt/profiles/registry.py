"""The routes, by name.

A route used to be a boolean. `freeCompositionEnabled` answered three separate
questions at once -- which stages run, which backend composes the pages, and
what the model may write -- so the assembly function grew ten branches on it,
and two of the branches contradicted each other well enough that a whole
sub-route (1500 lines of designer tooling) could not be reached under any
configuration at all. Nobody noticed, because a test had frozen the
unreachability as the expected behaviour.

Routes are values here, and a value can be enumerated, asserted about, and
listed in a table. `available()` answers "can this route actually run", which is
the question the assembly point should be asking instead of recomputing a
predicate.
