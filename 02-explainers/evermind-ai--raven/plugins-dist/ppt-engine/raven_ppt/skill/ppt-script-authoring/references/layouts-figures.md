# Passages: a figure and copy, a figure as a surface, a photograph as the page

The worked code for `P1`-`P7`, `P23`-`P27`, `P35` and the picture layers, behind
[deck/build/references/layouts.md](deck/build/references/layouts.md). One page needs one
of these; the registry is where you choose which.

Every block here runs. They assume the setup block of the skill's §3 plus `FACE`/`HAN` for
the theme's two faces, `INK`/`MUTED`/`ACCENT` for `T["foreground"]`, `T["muted"]` and
`T["accent"]`, `FIGURES` for the figure directory, and `frame = page()`.
A passage whose bands are measured before they are drawn ends that line as
`frame = page().holding(*heights)`, so the room the body was given and nothing asked for
becomes air above and below the run instead of a band of white along the page's foot (the
skill's §6.5). Not for a run something else already spreads into the whole body:
`card_group(..., down=True)` given the body puts the leftover between its own cards, and a
body cut to the sum of their heights first leaves them touching.

A passage whose figures carry a caption asks for the page's foot as well --
`frame = page(footer=True)` -- because the caption goes on one line in `footer()`'s `note`,
joined with `；` where the page has more than one figure, and never under the picture
(`M6`); the height that frees goes back to the figure. The strip's room comes out of the
body, so a citing page has 1.53-6.20in of it and not 1.53-6.78in: a run measured against
the taller one is refused by `take` at its last band, and `P1` and `P2` below are what
0.58in less body looks like.

They also assume the seven picture helpers from
[deck/build/references/layouts-primitives.md](deck/build/references/layouts-primitives.md)
-- `cover`, `scrim`, `vignette`, `clip`, `fade`, `duotone`, `lift`. Open that file first;
nothing here redefines them.

### P1 -- Figure left, copy right

Cut the figure's column to the figure before writing beside it: `picture_fit` centres
what is left of a band, so a column left uncut starts the figure half the leftover below
the copy's first line instead of level with it.

`card_size` levels the three cards beside it, so none is padded out to the lane, and the
`stack`'s gutter spends the lane's leftover height as the air between them rather than
leaving it in a heap at the bottom -- floored at `GUTTER`, so a lane with little slack
keeps the deck's own gap instead of closing below it. Three one-line cards need 4.49in of
the citing page's 4.67in body, so nothing labels them: a label over three cards whose own
titles already name them is the least of what this column holds.

```python
figure, said = frame.body.split_left(0.58)
tall = picture_size(f"{FIGURES}/fig1.png", figure).h
picture_fit(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig1.png", Box(figure.x0, figure.y0, figure.x1, figure.y0 + tall), T)
notes = [("layers", "共享权重", "四个阶段共用一套权重，只换输入。"),
         ("target", "唯一监督", "第三阶段是唯一带监督的一步。"),
         ("stopwatch", "下一步", "端到端 42ms，第二阶段占 61%。")]
tall = max(card_size(said.w, icon=i, title=h, body=b, font=FACE).h for i, h, b in notes)
down = stack(said).spread(*[tall] * len(notes))
for icon, head, body in notes:
    card(slide, down.take(tall), T, icon=icon, title=head, body=body, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
footer(slide, frame.footer, T, note="来源：论文 Figure 1 原图；图 1 四阶段流水线",
       font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### P2 -- Figure right, copy left

The mirror, and not the same page: the eye lands left first, so this is the one to
reach for when the argument leads and the figure corroborates.

Which is why the blocks here are not level, where `P1`'s are: an `accent_soft` band
(`M3`) at `LEAD_PT` outweighs the two cards under it, so the eye lands on it first and on
them second. A level set of three would say all three weigh the same, which on this page
they do not. The figure on this side is as wide as its column allows and its own aspect
caps its height there, so what the caption gave up is air under it rather than a taller
figure -- the copy column is the one that sets where this page ends.

```python
said, figure = frame.body.split_left(0.42)
down = stack(said)
lead = down.take(1.30)
plane(slide, lead, T, tint="accent_soft", radius=True)
write(slide, lead.inset(PAD + 0.08), "第 9 个 epoch 起验证集与训练集分离，早停点就在这里。",
      size=LEAD_PT, bold=True, colour=INK, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN, anchor="middle")
down.skip(GUTTER)
notes = [("trending_down", "第 4 个 epoch 后转平", "继续训练只买到 0.3 个点。"),
         ("history", "两次回落是学习率重启", "形状一致，不是数据问题。")]
rest = down.rest()
tall = max(card_size(rest.w, icon=i, title=h, body=b, font=FACE).h for i, h, b in notes)
beside = stack(rest).spread(*[tall] * len(notes))
for icon, head, body in notes:
    card(slide, beside.take(tall), T, icon=icon, title=head, body=body, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
tall = picture_size(f"{FIGURES}/fig2.png", figure).h
picture_fit(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig2.png", Box(figure.x0, figure.y0, figure.x1, figure.y0 + tall), T)
footer(slide, frame.footer, T, note="来源：论文 Figure 3；图 2 验证集与训练集的准确率曲线",
       font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### P3 -- Figure band across the top, copy in columns under it

For a figure that is wide and short. Give the band a share of the region and let
`picture_size` cut it to the figure inside that share, or the figure takes the whole
region and `rest()` refuses with nothing left.

```python
down = stack(frame.body)
allowed = Box(down.x0, down.y0, down.x1, down.y0 + down.left * 0.62)
band = down.take(picture_size(f"{FIGURES}/fig3.png", allowed).h)
picture_fit(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig3.png", band, T)
down.skip(GUTTER)
for box, (head, body) in zip(down.rest().columns(3), [
    ("采集", "四路信号，10Hz 对齐后入库。"),
    ("推理", "同一套权重，按任务拼装查询。"),
    ("下发", "结果写回工单，平均 42ms。"),
]):
    write(slide, box, [head, body], size=BODY_PT, colour=INK, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
footer(slide, frame.footer, T, note="来源：内部架构评审材料；图 3 系统全貌", font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### P4 -- One line of copy, the figure under it

The claim in one sentence at lead size, then the whole rest of the page as the figure.
The page that wants this is the one where the figure *is* the argument.

```python
down = stack(frame.body)
said = "把任务定义搬进输入，网络本身就与任务无关：同一组权重在推理时按需拼装查询集合。"
write(slide, down.take(text_size(said, frame.body.w, size=LEAD_PT, font=FACE).h), said,
      size=LEAD_PT, colour=INK, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
down.skip(GUTTER)
picture_fit(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig4.png", down.rest(), T)
footer(slide, frame.footer, T, note="来源：论文 Figure 2 原图；图 4 查询拼装", font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### P27 -- Serpentine: three rows, the figure changing side

`picture_fit` and not `cover`, because these are figures: the rows come out unlevel and
that is the right trade -- cropping three figures to a common band throws away the parts
of them the page is citing. The step number down the copy side is what makes the zigzag
read as an order rather than as three unrelated rows.

```python
rows = frame.body.rows(3, gutter=0.16)
serpentine = ((f"{FIGURES}/fig1.png", "left", "抽取阶段：四路信号在入库时对齐。"),
              (f"{FIGURES}/fig2.png", "right", "检索阶段：同一套权重按任务拼装查询。"),
              (f"{FIGURES}/fig3.png", "left", "写回阶段：结果落到工单，平均 42ms。"))
for index, (row, (figure, side, said)) in enumerate(zip(rows, serpentine)):
    if side == "left":
        picture, copy = row.split_left(0.34, gutter=GUTTER)
    else:
        copy, picture = row.split_left(0.62, gutter=GUTTER)
    picture_fit(slide, figure, picture, T)
    down = stack(copy)
    write(slide, down.take(0.36), f"0{index + 1}", size=LEAD_PT, bold=True, colour=MUTED,
          font=FACE)
    write(slide, down.rest(), said, size=BODY_PT, colour=INK, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN,
          anchor="middle")
```

### P5 -- Figure as the page's ground, notes laid over it

Put the notes in the figure's calm region and size them with `card_size`, not with a
fraction of the page: two cards stretched to half the height read as one panel.

```python
ground = Box.corners(0.0, frame.body.y0 - 0.10, CANVAS_W, CANVAS_H)
picture_fit(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig5.png", ground, T)
notes = [
    ("alert_circle", "瓶颈在第二阶段", "61% 的端到端时延落在这里。"),
    ("check", "第三阶段可停用", "关掉只掉 0.4 个点。"),
]
lane = Box.corners(MARGIN, CANVAS_H - MARGIN - 1.30, CANVAS_W - MARGIN, CANVAS_H - MARGIN)
for box, (icon, head, body) in zip(lane.columns(2, gutter=GUTTER), notes):
    tall = card_size(box.w, icon=icon, title=head, body=body, font=FACE).h
    card(slide, Box(box.x0, box.y1 - tall, box.x1, box.y1), T, tint="accent_soft",
         icon=icon, title=head, body=body, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### P6 -- Numbered hotspots on the figure, the legend down the side

The hotspots go on fractions of the box `picture_fit` hands back, which is the figure's
real extent and not the region it was given -- a fraction of the region puts the marks in
the white space around it, and with the caption gone `picture_fit` centres the figure in
the whole column, so that difference is vertical as well as horizontal.

These numbers are drawn *on* the figure, so they are not what the foot's note replaces:
they stay where they are, and the note accounts for the figure and says what the numbers
answer to.

```python
figure, legend = frame.body.split_left(0.62)
shown = picture_fit(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig5.png", figure, T)
for index, (fx, fy) in enumerate([(0.20, 0.42), (0.46, 0.30), (0.72, 0.42)], start=1):
    dot = Box.at(shown.box.x0 + shown.box.w * fx, shown.box.y0 + shown.box.h * fy, w=0.34, h=0.34)
    preset(slide, dot, T, "ellipse", tint="accent")
    write(slide, dot, str(index), size=LABEL_PT, bold=True, colour=T["background"],
          font=FACE, align="center", anchor="middle")
down = stack(legend)
for index, said in enumerate([
    "输入侧只保留时序颈，其余分支在这一步丢弃。",
    "查询拼装，任务切换发生在这里。",
    "解码头共享，不随任务变化。",
], start=1):
    band = down.take(max(0.46, text_size(said, legend.w - 0.5, size=BODY_PT, font=FACE).h))
    badge = Box.at(band.x0, band.y0, w=0.32, h=0.32)
    preset(slide, badge, T, "ellipse", tint="accent")
    write(slide, badge, str(index), size=LABEL_PT, bold=True, colour=T["background"],
          font=FACE, align="center", anchor="middle")
    write(slide, Box(band.x0 + 0.46, band.y0, band.x1, band.y1), said,
          size=BODY_PT, colour=INK, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
    down.skip(0.14)
footer(slide, frame.footer, T, note="来源：论文 Figure 1 改绘；图 5 标注了三处的流水线，编号对应右侧图例",
       font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### P7 -- One thing at the centre, leader lines out to what it reaches

`connect` picks its own edges from where the two boxes sit, so a hub-and-spokes needs
no coordinate. Draw the spokes in `MUTED`: in `T["grid"]` they disappear on white.

```python
cells = frame.body.grid(3, 3, gutter=0.30)
middle = cells[4]
preset(slide, middle, T, "ellipse", tint="accent_soft")
write(slide, middle, "统一查询集合", size=LEAD_PT, bold=True, colour=INK,
      font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN, align="center", anchor="middle")
for index, icon, said in ((1, "category", "分类"), (3, "layers", "分割"),
                          (5, "route", "跟踪"), (7, "search", "检索")):
    leaf = cells[index]
    connect(slide, middle, leaf, T, kind="straight", colour=MUTED)
    ink = the_ink_an_icon_covers(icon, 0.34)
    add_icon(slide, icon, Inches(leaf.x0 + leaf.w / 2 - ink.w / 2 - ink.x0),
             Inches(leaf.y0 + leaf.h / 2 - 0.42), Inches(0.34), ACCENT)
    write(slide, Box(leaf.x0, leaf.y0 + leaf.h / 2, leaf.x1, leaf.y1), said,
          size=BODY_PT, bold=True, colour=INK, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN, align="center")
```

### P23 -- A photograph as the whole page, the title floated on it

The scrim is what makes this publishable rather than a picture with words on it. Give the
title stack the end where the gradient is nearly opaque, and keep the whole of it there --
copy that starts inside the transition is the one the render will not carry.

```python
cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/photo.jpg", Box.corners(0.0, 0.0, CANVAS_W, CANVAS_H))
scrim(slide, Box.corners(0.0, 0.0, CANVAS_W, CANVAS_H), INK, 0.88, 0.05, angle=0.0)
down = stack(Box.corners(MARGIN, 2.30, 7.20, 6.20))
write(slide, down.take(0.40), "01 / 06 · 立论", size=KICKER_PT, colour=T["accent_soft"],
      font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
down.skip(0.10)
write(slide, down.take(2.20), "记忆不是一层缓存，\n是系统的第二套状态。", size=TITLE_PT + 10,
      bold=True, colour=T["background"], font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN, spacing=1.20)
write(slide, down.take(0.44), "2026 年战略审议 · 架构评审组", size=LABEL_PT,
      colour=T["accent_soft"], font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### P24 -- An image belt across the middle, copy above and below

The belt is built from the canvas rather than from `frame.body`, because a band that stops
at the safe margin is a picture in a box. Both long edges get a short gradient to the
page's own background: without them the belt has two horizontal rules nobody drew.

```python
down = stack(frame.body)
write(slide, down.take(0.52), "上半页说这条带子里有什么", size=LEAD_PT, bold=True, colour=INK,
      font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
down.skip(0.14)
band = down.take(2.10)
belt = Box.corners(0.0, band.y0, CANVAS_W, band.y1)
cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/photo.jpg", belt)
scrim(slide, Box.corners(0.0, belt.y0, CANVAS_W, belt.y0 + 0.40), T["background"], 1.0, 0.0, angle=270.0)
scrim(slide, Box.corners(0.0, belt.y1 - 0.40, CANVAS_W, belt.y1), T["background"], 1.0, 0.0, angle=90.0)
down.skip(0.16)
for box, said in zip(down.rest().columns(3, gutter=GUTTER), (
    "带子出血到两边画布边缘，页内没有一条竖直的白边。",
    "上下两个方向各有一层渐变，图带与页面的接缝看不出来。",
    "带子里不放字：字在带子上下，读起来是一页而不是两页。",
)):
    write(slide, box, said, size=BODY_PT, colour=INK, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### P25 -- A narrow full-height image strip beside a display-size title

This page carries its own header, like `P13`, so `page()` and `heading` are not called and
the rest of that section reads the same way. The strip is under a quarter of the width; at
a third it stops being a strip and starts being a column that owes the reader information.

```python
strip = Box.corners(0.0, 0.0, 3.10, CANVAS_H)
cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/photo.jpg", strip)
plane(slide, Box.corners(strip.x1, 0.0, strip.x1 + 0.06, CANVAS_H), T, tint="accent")
down = stack(Box.corners(strip.x1 + 0.70, 1.60, CANVAS_W - MARGIN, CANVAS_H - MARGIN))
write(slide, down.take(0.40), "03 / 06 · 分野", size=KICKER_PT, colour=MUTED, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
down.skip(0.12)
write(slide, down.take(2.40), "一条窄图带，\n一个大标题。", size=TITLE_PT + 14, bold=True,
      colour=INK, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN, spacing=1.18)
write(slide, down.take(0.46), "窄带占满整页高度，宽度不到四分之一，剩下的都留给字。",
      size=BODY_PT, colour=MUTED, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

One quiet line under the title and no more. A display-size page that then stacks two
claims under its own headline is arguing with itself; if the second claim matters, it is
the next page's.

### P26 -- A figure running to the canvas edge, the copy in the clear

The box ends *at* `CANVAS_W`. A shape whose box crosses the edge is reported by `off_page`
on every build, and it buys nothing: `cover` already throws away what does not fit, so a
box to the edge and a box past it look the same on the page.

The panel is cut to what its bands really need with `text_size` rather than to a share of
the column, and the hairline parting them is a thin `plane` in `grid`: `rule` is capped at
1.05in, so it cannot draw a line this wide.

```python
said, _ = frame.body.split_left(0.46)
rules = [("跑到边的一侧不承载信息", "那里只能是背景，或者一段延伸的纹理。"),
         ("字全部留在干净区域", "不与图重叠，也不压在图的渐变上。"),
         ("盒子止于画布边缘", "越过一寸和贴住边缘看起来一样，越过的那寸会被报告。")]
pad, air = PAD + 0.10, 0.16
bands = [0.34 + text_size(body, said.w - 2 * pad, size=LABEL_PT, font=FACE).h for _, body in rules]
panel = Box(said.x0, said.y0, said.x1,
            said.y0 + sum(bands) + 2 * pad + 2 * (2 * air + 0.015))
plane(slide, panel, T, tint="surface")
down = stack(panel.inset(pad))
for index, ((head, body), tall) in enumerate(zip(rules, bands)):
    band = stack(down.take(tall))
    write(slide, band.take(0.34), head, size=BODY_PT, bold=True, colour=INK,
          font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN, anchor="middle")
    write(slide, band.rest(), body, size=LABEL_PT, colour=MUTED, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
    if index < len(rules) - 1:
        down.skip(air)
        plane(slide, Box.at(down.x0, down.y, w=down.w, h=0.015), T, tint="grid")
        down.skip(air)
cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig1.png", Box.corners(6.80, frame.body.y0, CANVAS_W, frame.body.y1))
```

### P35 -- A chapter banner: two images of unequal weight over an oversized section number

A divider page, and the one place a deck can spend a whole page on almost nothing. The
number is the ground the title sits against, and its colour is a trade rather than a
taste: on this template `accent_soft` came back `unreadable` at 1.2:1 and refused the
deck; `grid` measures 2.1:1, which clears that bar and passes in silence, and is still a
number nobody wants a section title read at -- above 2:1 nothing is measured, so your
eye on the render is the only thing that catches it; `MUTED` is clean. A ghost number is
not free.

```python
upper = Box.corners(0.0, 0.0, CANVAS_W, 3.90)
small, dominant = upper.split_left(0.32)
cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig3.png", small)
cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/photo.jpg", dominant)
write(slide, Box.corners(MARGIN, 3.90, CANVAS_W - MARGIN, CANVAS_H - MARGIN), "04",
      size=TITLE_PT + 92, bold=True, colour=MUTED, font=FACE, anchor="middle")
down = stack(Box.corners(MARGIN + 2.60, 4.40, CANVAS_W - MARGIN, CANVAS_H - MARGIN))
write(slide, down.take(0.40), "第四节", size=KICKER_PT, colour=MUTED, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
write(slide, down.take(1.10), "破局路线与行动卡", size=TITLE_PT + 8, bold=True, colour=INK,
      font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
write(slide, down.take(0.44), "两层产品矩阵，三条集成路径，一张销售应对卡", size=LABEL_PT,
      colour=MUTED, font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN)
```

### M12-M24 -- the picture layers, stacked

They compose, and each is one call on the picture a structure already placed. A figure
cover-cropped into a hexagon and re-graded into the deck's two colours is three lines; a
photograph as a page ground with a spotlight on the one thing being discussed is two.
`box` below is whichever region the structure put the picture in.

```python
clip(duotone(cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/photo.jpg", box), INK, T["accent_soft"]), "hexagon")

shown = picture_fit(slide, f"{FIGURES}/fig1.png", box, T)      # M19 on a figure kept whole
shown.shape.line.color.rgb = rgb(ACCENT)
shown.shape.line.width = Pt(2)

cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/photo.jpg", Box.corners(0.0, 0.0, CANVAS_W, CANVAS_H))
vignette(slide, Box.corners(0.0, 0.0, CANVAS_W, CANVAS_H), INK, centre=0.0, edge=0.88)
plate = Box.corners(3.20, 3.00, 10.20, 4.50)
rect(slide, plate, INK, 0.62)                                  # the words go on the plate
write(slide, plate, "一束光打在要看的那一处", size=TITLE_PT + 6, bold=True,
      colour=T["background"], font=FACE, cjk_font=HAN, align="center", anchor="middle")

fade(cover(slide, f"{FIGURES}/photo.jpg", Box.corners(0.0, 0.0, CANVAS_W, CANVAS_H)), 0.22)
```

**What this renderer does not do.** The deck's own review renders through LibreOffice, so
a treatment PowerPoint would show and it drops is invisible to every check and to you.
`a:grayscl` and `a:blur` in a picture's `a:blip` are both accepted into the file and both
come back unchanged in the render -- desaturating or blurring a picture has to be done to
the pixels before they reach the deck. A picture fill inside run properties (letterforms
revealing the image through them) is accepted and renders as flat type, so text-as-mask is
not reachable on this route at all.
