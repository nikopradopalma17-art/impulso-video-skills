"""The band gate: filled colour bars carrying nothing.

This one reports rather than refuses, which for a matter of taste is the whole
of what it can honestly do. Prose could not hold the line. A strip welded to a
card edge, or a band across every title, is the loudest single tell of a
generated deck, and it came back in every deck that was merely asked not to draw
one -- so the instruction was replaced by a measurement on the built file, where
a bar is a bar however it was produced. The fix is a design one: let type weight
and size establish the hierarchy.

It refused decks until it had been wrong three times, and those three are
recorded below: bar series read as accent strips, planes carrying copy read as
empty bands, and a template's own kicker rule refused by an eighth of a
millimetre. Each was answered with another exemption, and an exemption is an
admission that the measurement does not know what it is looking at. A refusal has
to be right the first time. So the reading stays and the refusal goes (design doc D17). A fourth
misreading followed, as a warning this time -- the thin parts of a stacked column
read as accent strips -- which is the same admission, and the reason a reading is
all this is.

Two shapes are refused and one is allowed, and the allowance is the interesting
part. A narrow accent strip is refused wherever it sits. A full-width band is
refused only when nothing sits on it -- a plane with copy on it is grouping, and
grouping is what a tinted plane is for.

That allowance used to require the band be at the top of the page, the deck's
title row, and a 20-page academic deck is why it does not any more: five
full-width planes carrying formulas, a training schedule and a takeaway row came
back BLOCKING as "a band with nothing on it" while one to six text boxes sat on
each of them. The message was false, the author's only move was to delete good
grouping, and on the same page a plane 0.06in taller passed untouched -- above
`BAND_MAX_HEIGHT_EMU` it is a panel rather than a bar. Carrying copy is now the
whole test, which is what the gate's own first sentence says it is about.

    A stacked bar is not a series of bars and `_series_ids` cannot see one: its
    parts do not share a baseline, because each part stands on top of the one
    below it, and they do not share a thickness the way the values run, because
    there the thickness *is* the value. Three columns of three parts from
    `ppt_charts.stacked_bar` came back with a finding on each thin top part --
    2.46 x 0.09in, 2.46 x 0.13in, 2.46 x 0.08in, all "an accent strip" -- on the
    one chart in the set whose whole subject is a part too small to be a bar of
    its own. Only the parts sitting on the axis were exempt, and those by
    accident: they happened to share the axis with each other.

    So the parts are joined back into the bar they were cut from -- one slot, one
    thickness, edges meeting -- and the bars are then asked what `_series_ids`
    asks: two or more of them, in two or more slots, on one baseline, and not all
    the same shape. Congruence stands in for that test's "lengths differ", because
    a 100% stack makes every bar the same length on purpose and puts its values in
    where each one is cut.

    A strip welded to a card edge does not get in by this door. The recorded
    decoration is drawn *over* the card, and an overlap joins nothing: it opens a
    run of its own, exactly as a value drawn over its track does. Laid flush
    against the edge it does join, and then a lone card is one run in one slot,
    and a row of identical cards is a row of identical runs -- refused by the slot
    clause and by the congruence clause, the two the series test already leans on.
    What is left over is a row of cards of *different* heights each wearing the
    same thin strip, and that is the same picture as a stack whose first series is
    constant: bars of different lengths, each with an equal small part at one end.
