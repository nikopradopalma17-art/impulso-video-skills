"""The citation gate: a page cites the figure it actually shows.

A page saying "Fig. 4" beside Figure 5 is a provenance error a reader checks in a
second and nothing else here can see -- this is the deck's only check on what a page
credits. It went unnoticed until ingest started reading captions; before that nothing
knew which figure was which, and the author could only guess from the picture.

Which figure is on a page is decided by hashing the placed image against the
ingested files, so a page placing something this deck never ingested, or an
image a build program rebuilt on the way, simply goes unchecked. That is the
right failure: the gate refuses a deck, and it may only refuse on evidence.
