"""Gates on a built deck. Everything here returns `Finding`.

What a deck can be refused over is what it was agreed to be and what it credits:
`citation` (a figure cited as another figure), `page_budget` and `language` (the
two halves of the brief a built file can be held to), and `house_style` (a deck in
somebody else's colours). The list this docstring used to give was design doc D3's
and outlived it in two places: there has never been a check on a claim the materials
never make -- no stage builds an index of the numbers in them -- and `band` was
downgraded to a warning after three misfires (D17).

Everything else here reports. `band` and `page_mapping` are readings of a built
file, not verdicts on it; `thin_material` and the three `coverage` rows say what
could not be checked rather than what is wrong. Measurements of the rendered page
live in `services.measure` and are warnings for the reason D2 gives. `check_deck`
runs both packages and returns one list; a route's `blocking_kinds` decides which
of them stop publication, and every one of them is the author's to answer.
