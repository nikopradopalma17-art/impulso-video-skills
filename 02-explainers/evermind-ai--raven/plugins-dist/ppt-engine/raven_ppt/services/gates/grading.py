"""Which of the 43 checks a build is worth running, and when rebuilding has stopped paying.

Two failures, opposite in shape, argue for one table.

A reading that arrives at the finish line cannot be acted on: one 18-page run read
every page inside the build that delivered, reported 45 problems on 18 pages, and the
deck was published 38 seconds later, because answering 45 findings on a finished deck
means redoing every page (design doc D21). And a reading that never stops costs the
attention it was meant to buy: one live run carried a single `band` warning from 07:14
to 07:39 across nine builds and nineteen minutes of pure build time, still rebuilding
pages for it on iteration 36, and the finding was not answerable at all -- it was the
template's own device tripping a gate that had already been downgraded for misreading
exactly that (D17). D17 predicted the bill ("a known misfire is still noise, and noise
takes the attention the author should be spending on the page") and left no ceiling.

So: `TIERS` says what evidence each check consumes, `checks_for` says which ones this
particular rebuild can have moved, `converged` says when the loop has stopped answering
anything, and `NOISE_FLOOR` collects the differences already judged too small to report.

Nothing here decides severity. `registry.DISPATCH` is the only place that does, and a
check dropped from a batch is a check not run, never a check overruled: `checks_for`
returns every blocking row on every build that has the evidence for it, and returns all
43 for the build that delivers, so fail-closed publication (D3) is untouched.
