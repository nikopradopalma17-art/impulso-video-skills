"""One pass over a built deck, one list of findings.

The predecessor projected the same measurements three ways -- `_content_findings`,
`_page_findings`, `_render_defects` -- plus a fourth copy of the third, inlined in
the polish tool. Each returned a different shape (a list of dicts, a dict keyed by
page, another list of dicts), each wrapped its own group of checks in one `try` so a
crash in the first silenced the other two, and which of the three a problem appeared
in was decided by which function a call site happened to reach for.

So: one entry point runs everything, every check states its own severity, and a
caller filters. Adding a check no longer means choosing which of four functions it
appears in.

# What every check is allowed to conclude, as a table rather than as a habit.
#
# Not a second place severity is decided -- each check builds its own findings --
# but the specification those checks are tested against, so a check that quietly
# starts blocking the deck fails a test instead of stalling a run. The two axes
# and why each row falls where it does:
#
# BLOCKING is reserved for what a page credits (a figure cited as another figure),
# for what the deck was agreed to be, and for a deck the pipeline cannot reason
# about at all. It once also covered a number the materials never printed; that gate
# was deleted for firing ten times across seven runs and being wrong every time
# (design doc D3a), and nothing has replaced it. Everything else is a WARNING and rides along with the deck,
# because every remaining finding is satisfiable by shrinking the copy and a gate
# that refused publication until they cleared could be answered by making the
# page worse -- the oscillation of design doc D2, which ends with no deck at all.
#
# There was a second axis. Every row also named who was allowed to act on it,
# because a stage that could rearrange a page but not rewrite it had to be kept away
# from anything whose fix changes what a page says. That stage is gone: the author
# owns the program and can change anything in it, so every row below is the author's
# and the column said nothing. It was not free either -- filed under a heading that
# named somebody else, 25 pairs of overlapping words went unanswered across eight
# builds of one live run.
DISPATCH: Mapping[str, Severity] = {
    "citation": Severity.BLOCKING,
    # Filled colour bars carrying nothing. It refused decks until it had misfired
    # three times, each time on work that was correct, and each time the patch was
    # another exemption: eight bars on four rows read as accent strips on a page the
    # skill itself asks for ("ranking -> sorted horizontal bars"), so bar series had
    # to be detected and exempted; five full-width planes carrying formulas and a
    # takeaway row read as "a band with nothing on it" while one to six text boxes
    # sat on each, so the top-of-page requirement had to go; and a template's own
    # kicker rule, 0.04in tall and correct in the render, was refused under eight
    # titles by one eighth of a millimetre, so the hairline ceiling had to be
    # borrowed from the measurement module. A refusal has to be right the first time;
    # three exemptions in is not that, so this one reports. What it is about does not
    # change -- the strip is still the loudest tell of a generated deck.
    "band": Severity.WARNING,
    # Whether each page traces to its own block in build.py. What it protects is the
    # ability to match a render back to the code that drew it, not anything a reader
    # sees, so it reports: a deck whose pages are right and whose program is arranged
    # oddly is a deck, and refusing it buys the reader nothing.
    "page_mapping": Severity.WARNING,
    "page_budget": Severity.BLOCKING,
    "language": Severity.BLOCKING,
    "evidence": Severity.WARNING,
    "wide_table": Severity.WARNING,
    "native_table": Severity.WARNING,
    "banded_table": Severity.WARNING,
    # A caption written by looking at a figure rather than read off its source, and
    # naming something the materials never mention. Beside `citation` in what it is
    # about -- who says this picture is what the page says it is -- and a warning
    # rather than a refusal, because the name may well be printed in the pixels and
    # the answer is one sentence rather than a rebuilt page.
    "inferred_caption": Severity.WARNING,
    # A page whose outline planned a table and whose file holds none. With `citation`,
    # `page_budget` and `language` rather than with the layout warnings: it is a
    # disagreement between the plan and the file rather than a reading of a rendered
    # page, so D2's oscillation argument does not reach it -- nothing about it is
    # answered by making the page smaller. Refused, because the plan is what every
    # page after it is written against and because both answers are one edit: draw the
    # table, or call ppt_outline again for a plan that does not promise one. The twin
    # of `unplaced_figure`, which every route already refuses.
    # And the same page drawing a grid of another size. Reported, not refused: the
    # plan-time width warning tells an author to drop the columns the claim does not
    # rest on, so a refusal here would refuse the fix that warning asks for. What is
    # worth saying is that the plan and the deck now describe different tables.
    # The plan-time estimate, checked against the file that settled it: a plan wanting
    # more column width than the page carries, on a page whose drawn table is squeezed
    # or reaches past the margin. A warning with `wide_table`, which reports the same
    # shape -- two rows over one table, one refusing and one reporting, is the
    # contradiction `band` was downgraded for.
    # A page printing "48.3\\nOVIS" is not taste and not layout: the escape was escaped on
    # its way in, and the fix is one character in the author's program. That argument
    # asked for a refusal and got one; no measurement was ever taken behind it. Over the
    # seven runs and 932 findings D3b read one by one this check fired zero times, both
    # of the pages it is written from were found by a person reading a deck rather than
    # by the check, and one of those pages went out delivered -- so nothing here has
    # measured what it does to a page that legitimately prints a backslash outside the
    # quotes and brackets `_CODE_MARKS` exempts. Reported until something has (D52).
    "literal_escape": Severity.WARNING,
    # An expression written as prose. The fix is one call in the program.
    "flat_formula": Severity.WARNING,
    # Parallel claims stacked in one box, so they read as a list to be read out.
    # Reported and not refused with the other rows about a page's shape: the answer is
    # a block for each claim, which is a page rebuilt rather than a line changed.
    "listed_claims": Severity.WARNING,
    "type_floor": Severity.WARNING,
    # One slot the deck repeats, set at five sizes because the renderer shrank each
    # box to fit what went into it. The sizes even out by giving the boxes room, and
    # cutting the copy is the last resort.
    "type_drift": Severity.WARNING,
    # The same reading with the row for its own baseline instead of the declared size, and
    # it is a different finding rather than a tuning of that one. `type_drift` asks whether
    # a box came out under the size its slot was drawn at, which on one delivered page named
    # the four card headings at 16.8pt as the outliers and left the lone 20.0pt one standing
    # as the house style, and on the page after it reported all five members of a row that
    # renders uniformly at 17.4pt -- a row a reader has no complaint about. This one asks
    # whether the copies of one slot *inside a single repeating unit* agree with each other.
    # A warning for the reason both of its neighbours are: the honest fixes are evening out
    # what the units hold or setting the row one size, and D2 keeps a refusal off anything
    # whose answer is room taken from a neighbour or a line cut. Calibrated first: over the
    # ten bundled templates writing their own copy into their own boxes, 327 repeating rows
    # carry a render and two report, both in `green_aurora` and both rendered and looked at
    # -- card headings at 16.2 / 16.2 / 12.2 / 13.3pt and at 18 / 18 / 18 / 15.1 / 14.2pt,
    # visibly uneven. Over four decks of the previous era, 80 pages, it reports nothing.
    "row_type_drift": Severity.WARNING,
    # And whether the page's title still outranks the line under it. The knowledge gap
    # rather than the refusal, which is why it warns and why its message leads with the
    # number: a cloned title states no size and resolves to 28pt through the master, so an
    # author writing 28pt into the caption slot beneath it collides with a number nothing
    # in its program ever showed it. One delivered page has both at 28.01pt with the caption
    # the longer string, and a reader meets the caption as the heading. Held to a tie and not
    # to any inequality, because four of the templates' own pages set that line deliberately
    # larger -- a statistic, a section numeral, a pull-quote -- and each is an idiom.
    "outranked_title": Severity.WARNING,
    # And the size the author picked rather than the one the renderer produced: copy set
    # over the floor, under `BODY_PT`, at a number the ramp does not have. A warning with
    # the two rows above it and for the same reason -- raising a size costs room, and a
    # refusal could be answered by cutting the copy back.
    "type_scale": Severity.WARNING,
    # The one measurement that refuses. D2 said every measured layout problem
    # should only feed the loop, because hard-refusing invites the shrink-and-retry
    # oscillation text fitting already threatens. A rendered overlap is the
    # exception the user asked for after three runs delivered decks with copy
    # painted over copy: it is not taste, it is not answerable by shrinking (the
    # type floor is measured too, and shrinking trades one finding for another),
    # and the move it wants -- a wider box -- costs the page nothing.
    "word_collision": Severity.BLOCKING,
    # The quiet half of the same thing: content nothing collides with because it is
    # simply behind something. Reported rather than refused, unlike `word_collision`,
    # because the two halves do not stand on the same evidence. Its loud half reads the
    # render and refuses what a reader can be shown not to see; this one infers from the
    # file's z-order that a later shape is opaque and covers three fifths of an earlier
    # one, and that inference has already refused work that was correct: a grouped-shape
    # coordinate bug gave five refusals on one sound contents page (D15), and over
    # twenty real decks it fires on three, one of which is a bundled template whose page
    # renders exactly as designed while the finding says its card is wholly hidden.
    # Its own message says "Nothing on this page collides" -- the render disagrees with
    # it, and the refusal was the inference winning that argument. A refusal has to be
    # right the first time; this one is not yet. The reading stays.
    "covered_shape": Severity.WARNING,
    # A container holding far less than the room it took, or with a hole between the
    # things it does hold. Reported: how full a card should be is the author's call and
    # a page can be deliberately airy, but a card whose copy stops an inch short of its
    # own footnote is a card nobody finished.
    "sparse_container": Severity.WARNING,
    # A page offering the eye nowhere to land -- no display figure and no picture with
    # any weight. Reported, because what carries a page is a judgement.
    "no_anchor": Severity.WARNING,
    # Several blocks of copy in the body with nothing drawn between them. Reported and
    # not refused: one device is enough and a page may earn its plainness, but a body
    # whose grouping is only implied by where the boxes were put is a grid the reader
    # has to infer. 104 of the 105 content pages the bundled templates ship draw one.
    "undivided_body": Severity.WARNING,
    # A page carrying less copy than its kind of page needs to say anything.
    "thin_copy": Severity.WARNING,
    # And the same page when what it does not say is standing there in empty boxes.
    # Refused, which the row above is not, and the difference is what the fix can be:
    # a page twelve characters under a prose floor is answerable by padding it, which
    # is the oscillation D2 ends with no deck at all, while a page holding a title and
    # twenty-five empty frames is answerable only by writing the page. One live deck
    # sent eight of its sixteen pages out as the two lines one call had written, and the
    # only reason anyone noticed is that a ninth used an engine function that raises.
    "emptied_page": Severity.BLOCKING,
    # A picture stretched: the box's shape and the shape of the part of the file it
    # shows disagree. Reported rather than refused because the reading is new and the
    # crop and cover paths took three passes to read correctly.
    "figure_distortion": Severity.WARNING,
    # A frame that keeps less than half of its image: the crop, not the picture, is
    # what the reader sees. Reported, since the fix is a picture of another shape.
    "figure_crop": Severity.WARNING,
    # A picture too small for the job its size says it is doing.
    "figure_undersized": Severity.WARNING,
    # A mark that sits somewhere different on each page it appears on.
    "figure_mark_drift": Severity.WARNING,
    # A small picture parked in the title band, which is the deck's own furniture.
    "title_band_figure": Severity.WARNING,
    # A picture that is the page, washed to a share between texture and full strength:
    # type over it reads on fog. The cover that works has the photograph at full
    # strength under a plane of ink.
    "washed_backdrop": Severity.WARNING,
    # Two lines the file gives the same left edge and the render does not. The file's
    # own numbers say the author meant them flush, so the drift is a slip rather than
    # an indent -- the inset a text box carries is not visible in the geometry the
    # author wrote. Reported: it is a slip worth naming, not a page worth refusing.
    "flush_drift": Severity.WARNING,
    # The layout budgets, read off the built pages rather than off the plan that named
    # a layout: a page next to a page of the same shape, a deck that keeps reaching for
    # a row of equal cards, and a deck that divides every body into equal parts. All
    # three report -- repeating a shape can be the argument, and "varied enough" is not
    # a property a page has -- but the reading is what nobody had.
    "repeated_layout": Severity.WARNING,
    "equal_card_habit": Severity.WARNING,
    "symmetry_habit": Severity.WARNING,
    # Whether a page says which page it is. Every bundled template defines a page-number
    # placeholder on its master and puts one on no page, and python-pptx does not clone
    # a footer placeholder onto a slide -- so twelve of twelve templates and the decks
    # built from them shipped with none, and nothing measured it.
    "no_footer": Severity.WARNING,
    "unnumbered_pages": Severity.WARNING,
    # Groups of copy with nothing drawn around them. Everything on the page may pass --
    # nothing overflows, nothing collides, nothing is thin -- and a reader still cannot
    # see where one group ends, which is what a delivered deck was called out for.
    # Two column grids on one page. `flush_drift` asks whether the render kept boxes that
    # declare the same edge; this asks about edges declared 0.12in apart, which no reader
    # reads as a decision -- and where the grids' steps differ the miss grows across the
    # page.
    "grid_drift": Severity.WARNING,
    # Copy the file states and the render does not show, which is what a shape narrower
    # than its own words does: it clips instead of wrapping, and every other check
    # passes. A warning, because the render's text layer is one source of truth about
    # what a reader sees and a font that draws a glyph as blank would read the same way.
    "clipped_copy": Severity.WARNING,
    "rule_strike": Severity.WARNING,
    "card_overflow": Severity.WARNING,
    # The same escape measured against the box the copy was actually put in rather than
    # against a panel it sits over, which is the gap a live page fell through: its last
    # line rendered 0.30in under its own text box, over the template's corner ornament,
    # and all sixteen findings on that deck were about something else. A warning, with
    # `card_overflow` and `overset_copy` and against the argument that would make it
    # refuse. It is real and it is not taste -- but unlike `word_collision`, whose fix
    # is a wider box and costs the page nothing, the fix here is height taken from a
    # neighbour or a line cut, which is exactly the trade D2 says a refusal must not
    # force. And `overset_copy` predicts this same defect from font metrics and only
    # reports: one deck state, two rows, one refusing and one reporting, is the
    # contradiction `band` was downgraded for.
    "box_overflow": Severity.WARNING,
    # The other side of the same rim: copy inside its panel and touching the edge. Found
    # by reading a polished deck page by page -- two note cards ended on their last
    # line's descender while every other card on that deck carried 0.20in of padding.
    "crowded_panel": Severity.WARNING,
    # A label the render broke one character short of fitting. Four of eight labels on
    # one delivered agenda page read "为什么要统 / 一"; the words do not collide, the copy
    # fits the box's height, and the type is the right size.
    "orphan_line": Severity.WARNING,
    # Two groups with no more air between them than inside them, which is the one thing
    # the design brief asks for in prose and nothing measured: "a gap that is plainly

    "unseparated_blocks": Severity.WARNING,
    "excessive_whitespace": Severity.WARNING,
    # A deck whose composed pages nearly all came out as the same arrangement of the
    # same kinds of thing. A warning and deliberately not more: "varied enough" is not
    # a property a page has, a series of pages built alike so a reader can compare them
    # is good work, and a refusal here would be a refusal of a design judgement the
    # measurement is not entitled to make. What it is entitled to is the reading, which
    # nothing else produces -- every page of the deck this was written for passed every
    # other check while four of them were the same eight lines of code. The plan's
    # `layout` column is read for the same concentration a build earlier, by
    # `tools.outline._layout_spread`, off the same thresholds; that reading is not a
    # row here because this table is what a *built* deck is held to.
    "layout_variety": Severity.WARNING,
    "wrapped_label": Severity.WARNING,
    # Copy that does not fit the box it was put in, decided by measurement rather
    # than by looking at what the renderer did with it. The render checks could only
    # report the consequence -- words on top of words -- one round later.
    "overset_copy": Severity.WARNING,
    # And the half of that reading which does not run on into room below the frame.
    # A frame anchored to the middle or the bottom of its box sets the lines it cannot
    # hold *above* the first one, so the copy leaves the page or lands on copy that is
    # already there -- the second measurement that refuses, and it passes the test D2
    # set for the first one. It is not taste: the words are somewhere no reader reads
    # them, and the render agrees -- one delivered page's four card labels each painted
    # their first line over the sentence beneath them. It is not answerable by
    # shrinking: a frame that shrinks its type to fit displaces nothing and is not
    # reported here at all, so the check never asks for the trade the type floor would
    # then refuse. And the move it wants costs the page nothing -- one anchor, or one
    # place() -- which is exactly `word_collision`'s argument, made one round earlier
    # off font metrics instead of off the render. What it deliberately does not refuse
    # is the other direction: copy running on below its frame is `box_overflow`'s
    # report, whose fix is height taken from a neighbour or a line cut, which is the
    # trade D2 says a refusal must not force. Calibrated before it was raised: over the
    # ten bundled templates' own copy in their own boxes, 42 boxes are overset and none
    # is displaced; over 25 delivered decks it fires on one, three times, on the page
    # its run was called out for.
    "displaced_copy": Severity.BLOCKING,
    "off_page": Severity.WARNING,
    # And the box that never reached the page at all: copy in a frame declared with no
    # height or no width -- one live page came back as the template's background and its
    # footer with the whole page's words in a 0in-tall title. Reported, with its
    # neighbours here. It was written as a refusal on the argument that a box of no size
    # shows nothing whatever the copy says, and that argument is still sound; the
    # evidence under it is not. Its calibration was 531 pages for one finding and no
    # false positives (D52), and a single positive cannot show what a gate costs on the
    # work it reads wrongly -- which is the whole of what downgraded `band` and
    # `covered_shape` above, both of them also right about the page they were written
    # for. That one page traced to the author program's own safe-area constants rather
    # than to anything the engine emits, so nothing yet says this shape is one the
    # pipeline produces either. The reading stays; only the refusal goes.
    "boxless_copy": Severity.WARNING,
    # A shape inside the page whose copy is not: a box with wrapping off does not clip,
    # it paints straight out of itself, and two page titles of one delivered deck ran off
    # the canvas that way while every other check passed.
    "spilled_copy": Severity.WARNING,
    # Not findings about the deck at all, but about which of the rows above were
    # able to run. Warnings for the same reason the checks they stand in for
    # report nothing: an absent input is not a defect, and refusing on one would

    "unchecked_citations": Severity.WARNING,
    "unchecked_agreement": Severity.WARNING,
    "unrendered": Severity.WARNING,
    # A deck in somebody else's colours is not a deck the user asked for, and the fix
    # is one line at the top of the program rather than a rearranged page -- so this sat
    # with the language row and refused. It reports instead (D52), because the argument
    # is all there is: the defect it names was seen twice before this existed and the
    # check has never been recorded firing, no template or deck sweep stands behind it,
    # and the one test for the ordinary case compares a deck against itself, which is
    # true by construction and could not have found a false positive. The predicate is
    # also the least forgiving here -- any one theme slot differing refuses the whole
    # deck -- and an author who repainted the theme in its own program gets told it did
    # not open the template, which it did. A refusal whose stated reason is wrong is
    # what `template_underlay` was narrowed for.
    "house_style": Severity.WARNING,
    # The place, where `type_drift` measures the size: the title row is the one element
    # every page of a deck shares, and a deck whose titles start at three different left
    # edges reads as three decks. Reported, because a page may earn its own treatment.
    "title_row": Severity.WARNING,
    # A placement problem, answered by moving a block, and it warns: a deliberate
    # overlay is a legitimate design, and refusing on placement invites the
    # shrink-and-retry of design doc D2.
    "over_layout_art": Severity.WARNING,
    # A deck built inside a template that did not open, index, divide or close in the
    # template's own pages. `house_style` only compares theme colours, which a program
    # passes by opening the template at all, so this was invisible: a live deck drew all
    # eight of its pages from scratch and every check came back green. The content
    # pages in between are meant to be composed rather than cloned, so this no longer
    # counts them.
    "template_adherence": Severity.WARNING,
    # And the opposite failure of the same pair: a page that cloned a prototype and
    # left its placeholder copy in place. Refused, not reported -- a page saying
    # "single-click here to add a subtitle" is finished by nobody's standard.
    "placeholder_copy": Severity.BLOCKING,
    # The other half of the same reading: the template's numerals, glyphs and lone
    # tokens, which say nothing about whether the page was written. Reported, folded to

    A live 19-page run came back with the same title-row warning on every page: one
    shared cause, in the setup every page is drawn from, and nineteen findings saying
    so. The model spent a round on each, because nineteen concrete per-page problems
    read as nineteen decisions. This is the same fold `build`'s root-cause note makes
    for a page wrong at the root, applied across pages rather than down one.

    What counts as one cause is read off the findings rather than declared here: same
    kind, same severity, and the same message word for word. A message
    that names what is wrong with the page it is on -- a number that page states, a
    placeholder it left in -- differs per page and stays per page, which is why there
    is no list of kinds to keep in step with the registry. More than one page is what
    makes a cause repeated; there is no count to tune.

    The collapsed finding is deck-wide, because that is what it is: the pages it names
    are in `on_pages` and in the message, and its severity is the one it had, so an
    aggregated blocking finding still blocks. That also takes it out of `by_page`,
    which is the intended half of the trade -- a cause shared by nineteen pages is not
    answered by a pass that sees one page at a time.
