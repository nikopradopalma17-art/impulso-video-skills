"""Findings a build does not repeat, because repeating them changed nothing.

Six measured deck runs, 34 to 3 pages, were read build by build for what each
gate said and what the author did next. Four kinds of noise came out of it, each
with a rule here:

* A page the runner stood in for (`page_failed`) carried two to four more
  findings about the placeholder itself -- its font, its decoration share, its
  likeness to the page before. The placeholder is not the page; only the
  failure is reported.
* `repeated_layout` fired seventeen times in one deck, every one on the fifteen
  consecutive paper pages the user had confirmed as one uniform format. Two
  adjacent pages the outline gives the same prototype or layout are meant to
  match.
* `prototype_kept` ("N% of its shapes sit where the template's page puts one")
  was reported 26 times across 12 pages and acted on zero times; the delivered
  deck still carried it. It is said once per page and then left to the author.
* `excessive_whitespace` and `sparse_container` asked for 38 fills on a deck
  whose brief said white ground and generous whitespace. When the brief asks
  for air, air is not a finding.

`placeholder_marks` is said once per page for the same reason as `prototype_kept`:
the template's numerals and glyphs on a cloned page are advisory, the author may be
keeping them on purpose, and a page told twice is told for nothing. `layout_picture`
is said once per deck: it names the layouts whose artwork every page on them shows,
ends by saying an illustration is the design and is kept, and came back word for
word on ten of ten builds of one delivered deck.

A fifth rule, and the only one here about two gates contradicting each other
rather than one repeating itself. `type_drift` and `row_type_drift` measure the
same slot against two baselines: the size the slot was drawn at, and the row's
own spread. Where both speak about one slot on one page -- 3 of the 19 type
findings on one delivered 14-page deck -- their moves disagree, and one of them
is the move the other names as wrong: "give the boxes the height one size needs"
fixes the card it is aimed at and leaves the row uneven, which is what the row
reading exists to say. So the row's reading wins on the slot they share, and
`type_drift` keeps the 6 slots on that deck the row reading cannot see.

The slot they share is stated as the boxes both findings are about, because
neither one's own group key is available to the other: a row's level is a slot
inside a repeating unit and `type_drift`'s group is a shape repeated anywhere in
the deck. Comparing `[width, height]` instead made this rule read two levels of
one page that happen to be drawn the same size as one slot, and silenced a
finding the row reading had never looked at.
