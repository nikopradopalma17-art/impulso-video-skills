"""Which checks could not run, said out loud.

Every gate in this registry is written so that a missing input means it reports
nothing. No brief and the page budget and the language check are silent; no
figure labels and the citation check is silent; no render and three of the
measurements are silent. Each of those is the right call on its own, and
together they produce a reply in which "checked and clean" and "never checked at
all" are the same reply. These close that gap.

Three checks rather than one, so each is a row in the registry beside the checks
it stands in for, can be asked for alone, and has its own kind for a profile to
declare on. Warnings, all of them: an absent input is not a defect in the deck,
and refusing on one would be the refusal the other gates correctly decline to
invent. What they change is what the reply -- and the report written beside the
published file -- is able to claim.

`unrendered` answers two questions rather than one, because "no PDF came back"
has two causes and they take opposite remedies. A machine with no LibreOffice is
a deployment fact and installing it is the fix; a machine that has one and a deck
that still has no PDF is a fact about the deck, and telling that author to
install a renderer sends them at the one thing that is already there. The probe
that tells them apart is the same one the converter itself uses.

And a render that came back is not automatically a render that can be measured. A
page image that is blank, empty or the wrong size has none of what the pixel
measurements look for, so all of them pass and the page reads as clean; the sanity
pass in `render.unusable_pages` is what turns that silence into a report. It runs
over the page images this review already has -- the ones handed over on the record,
else the ones the contrast measurement wrote beside the PDF earlier in this same
registry pass -- so it costs no second rasterisation, and reports nothing when
there are none to look at.
