"""Reading "Figure 3: ..." off a page and deciding which picture it names.

Extracting these was the missing half of figure ingestion. A deck whose
figures arrive unlabelled has nothing tying one to the claim it is evidence
for, so the model numbers them by guessing: real runs cited "Fig. 4" under a
page showing Fig. 5, and used a paper's own teaser figure to argue the
opposite of what it shows. Neither is catchable afterwards -- the label has to
come off the page, at extraction time, for every path that emits a figure.

Geometry only, no pixels: a caption belongs to the thing it sits over or under
and shares columns with.
