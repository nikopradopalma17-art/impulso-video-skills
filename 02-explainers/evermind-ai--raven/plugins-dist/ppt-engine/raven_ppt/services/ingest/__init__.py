"""Material ingestion: source documents -> text + assets + a catalogue of both.

The one entry point is :func:`ingest_materials`. Everything else exported here
exists because another part of the system has to agree with this one:

* a figure-cropping tool needs the same pixel operations the ingest used;
* whatever reads the catalogue back needs the loader that wrote it.

Nothing here calls a model, and nothing here knows which route a deck is being
built by.
