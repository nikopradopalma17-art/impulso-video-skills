"""One ingestion run: materials in, a deck's worth of source out.

Two artefacts, and the whole of the deck's grounding rests on them:
``materials.md`` is the text a model reads and quotes, and ``figures/`` plus its
catalogue is the imagery -- extracted, never generated, so there is no surface
on which a figure can be invented.

Deterministic and offline by construction: no model is called from here, and
running it twice on the same directory produces the same two artefacts.

Reading is also cached per source file, keyed by its bytes. That matters because the
deck's source set accumulates -- a fetch adds one document and the whole set is read
again -- and reading a PDF means parsing it and cutting its figures out, seconds
each. One live run parsed the same two papers twice for want of this. A file whose
bytes are unchanged is not read again; anything else about the run is recomputed, so
the three artefacts are still a pure function of the set.
