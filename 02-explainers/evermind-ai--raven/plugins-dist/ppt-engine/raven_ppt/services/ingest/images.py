"""Pixel work on an extracted figure: trim it, measure it, cut a panel out.

Three source realities drive everything here. Bitmaps pulled out of
"print to PDF" exports arrive as one huge uniform bar (often 60%+ black
letterboxing) around a thin strip of real content; vector renders of paper
figures carry white margins; and product materials ship whole-page
screenshots, while papers ship one figure holding six labelled panels. Placed
as they come, the first two waste most of a slot on border and the last two
shrink past the point where their own text is readable.

So: :func:`autocrop_border` trims a uniform border in place and conservatively
-- any doubt (mixed corner colours, an empty or tiny content box, an
unreadable file) leaves the image untouched. :func:`estimate_panels` and
:func:`detect_panels` find the panels, :func:`segment_page_blocks` finds a
page's content blocks, and :func:`crop_figure` performs the one operation that
rescues either case: cut out the part actually being cited.

Every measurement is fail-soft: an unreadable image reports the value that
warns about nothing, because a failed read is not evidence against a figure.
