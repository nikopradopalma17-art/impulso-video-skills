"""Defects only the render shows: words on words, rules through words, words
escaping their card.

All three are mixed ground truth, and the mix is the design. The shape
positions come from the .pptx, where a filled panel or a hairline is exact and
will never be moved; the word positions come from the rendered PDF, where they
are true. The two share a point coordinate system with its origin at the top
left, so they can be compared without a transform.

The thresholds here are calibrated against one hand-built reference deck --
reviewed, accepted, and known good -- on which every check below reports
nothing. That is what they are for: a measurement that fires on a page a reader
would call fine costs the author a rebuild and teaches it to distrust the
gates.

    bottom of its card onto blank page, or onto the card's border, escapes it.

    **A label the author placed outside the card is not escaped copy**, and telling
    the two apart is what `copy_by_page` is for. The question is which side put the
    word where it is: escaped copy sits in a box that is inside the card and the
    renderer pushed the line out of it, while a number badge welded to a card's
    corner sits in a box the author drew hanging over the edge. Without this the
    check reported the badge on every cloned card page -- two findings a page, in
    two separate measured runs -- and one of those runs read the report, looked at
    the page, and wrote off the whole finding as "the template's number badge, a
    false positive". It was right, and the same page had copy running under the
    template's centre artwork that nothing here measures. A gate that cries wolf
    is what teaches an author to stop reading it.

    Without `copy_by_page` the older behaviour stands, badge and all: a caller with
    no .pptx to hand cannot answer the question, and guessing it from the word's
    own geometry is what produced the false positive.

    One card, one finding, and the finding carries the number to act on. Reporting
    each escaped word separately put nine findings on one deck for three cards, and
    saying only that copy "has outgrown the card" left the author guessing between
    two moves: a live run spent fourteen requests alternating between this and
    `word_collision`, shortening the copy until the card fit and lengthening the card
    until it hit its neighbour. The height the copy actually needs is already
    measured here -- withholding it is what made the two findings look like a
