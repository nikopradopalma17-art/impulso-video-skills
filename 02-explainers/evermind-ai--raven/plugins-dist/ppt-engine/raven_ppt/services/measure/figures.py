"""What a picture on the page actually shows, against what it was drawn from.

The one family of defect no gate in this repo could see. Forty-three checks measure
the built deck and not one of them compares a picture frame's proportions with the
proportions of the image inside it, or asks whether a figure is large enough to read.
The single ratio test that exists -- `template.compose.FIT_RATIO_LIMIT` -- guards one
route, the template's own `replace_picture`, and raises there; an author who writes
`slide.shapes.add_picture(path, left, top, width=w, height=h)` states both extents
and nothing looks at the result. `replace_picture`'s own docstring concedes that
`fit="stretch"` "distorts to fill, which is visible in any screenshot with type in
it", and no measurement backs that sentence up.

The evidence that the hole is real is that a model closed it by hand: in one live run
it shelled out to python-pptx mid-build to print `region aspect: 1.253 / box aspect:
1.253` for itself. A check the author has to write is a check that is missing.

**A crop is not a distortion.** A .pptx picture carries a source rectangle
(`a:srcRect`) naming the part of the image that is shown, and a stretch fill carries
its own inset (`a:stretch/a:fillRect`) naming the part of the frame the source is
mapped onto -- negative insets are how a designer expresses "cover". Reading only
`shape.image.size` reports both as distortion. On the calibration set that is not a
corner case, it is a third of the reading: across 250 pictures in the twelve bundled
templates and eight built decks, comparing raw pixels against the frame reports 81
distortions, the worst of them 4.26x, and every one is false. Reading `a:srcRect` and
stopping there still reports 37. Reading both reports none. One delivered deck is the
whole argument in miniature: five photographs, each cropped 8% to 37% off two sides,
and the naive reading calls all five distorted.

Everything here is a WARNING. The picture families the predecessor refused were
refused on aesthetic judgement and had to be walked back three times (design doc D17);
a frame's proportions are the author's decision to make, and a check that can be
answered by deleting the figure is worse than one that is read and ignored.

    -- that one came from rendering the page and looking at it, and it is the only
    picture of the calibration set's 250 the rest of this check reaches. Anything the

    without the exemption a drifting logo comes back as four findings for one problem.
    And a picture whose bottom edge is past the band is not sitting in it; that one
    excludes nothing on the calibration set, because `Bands.where` already wants most of
    a shape inside a band before it says so, and it is stated here because "in the
