"""Whether a deck's composed pages are all the same page.

The one defect in this family that no other measurement can see. Every page can pass
every check -- the type on the ramp, nothing colliding, nothing off the canvas, the
title row where the template puts it -- and the deck still be eleven pages of the same
composition. A delivered 20-page deck was exactly that: of its composed pages, four are
the same eight lines of code, a table over one rounded `plane` in `surface` with three
`points` under it, and the reader's experience of page 18 is that they have already
seen it three times.

Read off the built file rather than off the plan. The plan can say what the page was
meant to be; only the shapes say what it became, and the two disagreeing is precisely
the case a declaration cannot be trusted to report on itself.

A warning and never a refusal. "Varied enough" is not a property a page has -- a series
of pages built the same way so a reader can compare them is good work, and so is a deck
whose material genuinely wants one shape twice. What is reportable is the reading: this
many of your composed pages came out as the same arrangement of the same kinds of
thing. The author decides whether that was the argument or the path of least
resistance.
