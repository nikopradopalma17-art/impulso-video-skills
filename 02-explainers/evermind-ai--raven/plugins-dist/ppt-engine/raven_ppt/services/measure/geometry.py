"""Declared geometry: what the .pptx file itself says is where.

Two ground truths measure a built page and this is the one that comes off the
file. It is exact for everything the renderer will not move -- a picture, a
filled panel, a hairline rule, a table -- and wrong for text, which the
renderer reflows inside its frame: a word's declared position is where its box
was put, not where the word landed. So text positions come from
`measure.words`, read off the render, and what lives here is the shape walking
and the unit arithmetic every measurement needs.

In one copy, which it was not. The predecessor carried `_iter_shapes` and
`_walk_shapes` -- the same six lines -- in two modules, `_is_panel` and
`_is_filled` likewise, and inlined the same "has this shape any text" test at
five call sites. Nothing had gone wrong with that yet; it is the shape of thing
that goes wrong quietly, when one copy is taught about grouped shapes.
