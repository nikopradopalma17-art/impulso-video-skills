"""What size a built page's copy ends up at, and the floor it has to clear.

Almost everything else about a page is better judged by looking at it: a pass
holding the render sees a hole in the layout, uneven cards or a figure fighting
its caption more reliably than any measurement of the pixels. Type size is the
exception, and not because it is subtle -- because a bitmap carries no ruler. At
the size a page is reviewed, 11pt and 16pt both look fine, and a deck whose body
copy sits at 11.5pt reads as perfectly legible right up until it is projected in
a room.

The first version measured it off the .pptx and called that exact. It is exact
about the wrong number. A template's text box carries `<a:normAutofit/>` -- shrink
the text until it fits -- and often no size at all, so the file states nothing and
the renderer decides. On a live deck built from a six-card prototype, four cards
holding one sentence each came out at 11.7, 13.7, 13.5 and 10.8pt on page 8 and
13.5, 13.5, 13.5 and 11.1pt on page 10, out of one 18pt slot. No run in any of
those boxes declares a size, so the census skipped every one of them and both
pages were reported clean while a reader could not read either.

So the size that matters is read off the render, where autofit has already
happened, and the file's own number is kept beside it: the gap between the two is
the finding's explanation. Nobody chose 10.8pt -- a box too small for its copy did,
and the fix is the box or the copy rather than the size.

That same pair of numbers answers the other half of the complaint, which is not
that one page is small but that pages disagree. One slot repeated across a deck
has one size, and a reader reads a page against the page before it; eight cards
set at five sizes reads as unfinished however legible each one is. `drift_findings`
groups the boxes a deck repeats -- same declared size, same shape, wherever they
are -- and reports the ones the renderer set apart from the rest.

Both of those read the render. `scale_findings` reads the file, because it asks a
different question: not what a reader gets but what the author chose. `ppt_layout`
hands an author a ramp -- `BODY_PT` 16, `LABEL_PT` 14, and the steps above -- and
across ten live pages those constants were named zero times; every page picked its own
integer, thirteen distinct values from 10 to 32pt. The floor cannot see that, because
a page whose copy is set at 15pt is legible, deliberate-looking and one point under
what its own deck calls body: 15 of the 43 copy blocks measured across 34 generated
decks are at 15pt, more than at any other size, and `type_floor` reports none of them.
So the division of labour is the floor itself. Under it, `type_floor` already says
"bring it up" about the same box; between the floor and `BODY_PT`, at a size the ramp
does not have, nothing said anything at all.

Two more readings sit here, both about a page the author cloned rather than drew, and
both asking about a *pair* of boxes rather than one. `drift_findings` above groups one
slot's copies deck-wide and measures each against the size the slot was drawn at, which
answers "did this box shrink" and not "do the boxes beside each other agree" -- on one
delivered page it named the four card headings that came out at 16.8pt as the outliers
and treated the lone 20.0pt as the house style, and on the page after it reported all
five members of a row that renders uniformly at 17.4pt, where a reader sees nothing
wrong at all. The row's own rendered spread is the missing question, not a missing
input, and `row_findings` asks it. `outranked_findings` asks the other one: whether the
page's title still outranks the line under it, which on a cloned page is a number the
author was never shown.

    The state a reader describes as two competing headings, and on the page that named

    a measurement rather than taste is that both numbers are in the render: one
    delivered page has its title and its chart caption at 28.01pt each, the title 37
    characters and the caption 57.

    Read off the render for the same reason everything else here is. The file says the

    `template` decides what the finding *asks for*, and it is the difference between
    right and wrong advice rather than a filter. Where the box carrying the stated size

    same number, and a card whose heading and body are both 3x0.6in at 20pt is the

    neither row drifts at all -- the headings agreeing with each other at 20pt and the
    bodies agreeing with each other at 14pt is the deck behaving.

    Where it sits is its rank down the page among the unit's slots -- `_slots_of` decides
    which frames those are and `_place` reads the box off the page and orders on it, top
    to bottom and then left to right. The rank is fixed over the slots and only then are
    the frames this reading cannot use dropped, which is the difference between a
    structural position and a position in the copy that happens to be there: an option
    one unit left unspoken must not shift the ordinal of every slot under it in that unit
    alone. Ranking the frames that hold words did exactly that -- two cards with an
    optional label over an identical body slot, the label supplied on the second card
    only, put the two bodies at ranks 1 and 2 and stopped comparing them, so a row
    running 20pt against 14pt reported nothing.

    Not `_reading_order`, which is how `fill` addresses the slots of a unit and is right
    for writing into one and wrong as an identity. It bands shapes into rows so a number
    beside a heading is met before it; the band grows as shapes join it, so its membership
    turns on the order they were scanned in, and that order comes off `shape.top`, which a
    grouped shape states in its own group's coordinate space. Two units of one run

    Which frames of a unit count as slots, decided by the run rather than by the unit,
    and this is the load-bearing definition of the reading above. A built page cannot ask
    the prototype: `adapt` empties every frame it was not told about, so an icon's
    container and a body slot the author had nothing to say about arrive at this function
    looking the same -- both empty, both still standing. The run is what can tell them
    apart. A shape that holds copy in some unit is a slot, and its emptiness in another
    unit is an option that unit declined; a shape empty in every unit of the run is
    furniture -- an icon container, a spacer, a rule -- and never had a position to hold.

    It is `fill`'s own rule read across the run instead of within one unit. `fill` calls a
    frame a spacer because the frames beside it in that unit hold text; a sibling unit
    that filled the same shape is strictly better evidence than that, and it is the
    evidence that decides the case `fill` cannot see, where the option is the *first*
    slot of the unit and its absence shifts everything after it.

    Stable across the units of one run because it is computed once for the run: every
    unit ranks against the same set, and whether a frame belongs to it turns on the run's
    copy rather than on which unit is being read.

    Measured all three ways over the ten bundled templates and the nine decks. Counting
    every text frame instead costs a true positive its whole row: `green_aurora`'s zigzag
    timeline draws the icon container above the heading in one of five units and below it
    in the other four, so the odd card falls out and page 11 reports four of five.
    Counting only the frames that hold copy is the false silence this replaces, and it is
    in the delivered corpus as well as in the synthetic case -- `v13_warm` page 5 has a
    4.45x0.7in slot whose two copies were never compared, because one unit left an
    earlier option unspoken. This definition keeps both: the templates come back
    unchanged at 332 rows with page 11 whole, and the decks gain that one pair.
