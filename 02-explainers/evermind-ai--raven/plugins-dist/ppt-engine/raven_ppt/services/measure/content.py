"""How much a page carries, and whether it shows anything.

Three measurements of content rather than arrangement, and the difference used to
decide who heard about them. A stage that could rearrange a page and never change
what it says was handed "this page carries three times what a slide holds", which
it could not answer: the same overloaded page came back arranged into a card grid
however often it was redesigned. That stage is gone and every finding goes to the
author, who can cut the copy -- but the distinction is still what these three
measure, and it is still the reason none of them is answerable by moving a box.

    """Tables still wearing the look Office gives one nobody styled.

    The predecessor reported every shape whose `has_table` was true, which measured
    the component and not the defect. `ppt_layout.table()` is built on `add_table`
    too -- there is no other way to put a table in a .pptx -- so the deck's own table
    helper reported on every page it drew, while the thing it exists to prevent and
    the thing it produces were counted the same. A gate that fires on the best answer
    available teaches the author to avoid the best answer available.

    What is measurable off the file, and what a reader actually sees, is the pair the
    helper takes off and a bare `add_table` keeps. One page of each, saved and read
    back:

        ppt_layout.table()   <a:tblPr firstRow="1"/>              no tableStyleId
        slide.shapes.add_table()
                             <a:tblPr firstRow="1" bandRow="1">   {5C22544A-...}

    So the two clauses, and the threshold is exact rather than tuned: banding is on
    or it is not, and the style id is that GUID or it is somebody's choice. Both
    survive into the render whatever palette the deck is in, and neither was chosen
    by anyone -- python-pptx stamps both on a table it creates.

    What this deliberately does not judge is how much of its region a table fills.
    Columns sized from their content make a table of short values come out narrow,
    and nothing in the file says whether the page wanted it that way; that reading
    needs the render and belongs to the pass that holds one (see the skill, S6).
