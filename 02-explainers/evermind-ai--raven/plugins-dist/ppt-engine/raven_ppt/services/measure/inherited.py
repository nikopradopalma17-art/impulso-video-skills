"""What the layout draws, which no other measurement here could see.

A master's and a layout's own shapes never reach `slide.shapes`. They render --
they are most of what a template looks like -- but every geometry check in this
package reads the slide, so all of them were blind to them. Two consequences, and
both were verified rather than reasoned about.

The harmless one: a band a corporate template paints across its header is invisible
to the band gate, so using the user's own template is never refused for the user's
own design.

The one this closes: a page can lay its copy straight across the illustration the
template paints and nothing measures a thing. Three real templates, three pages
each, built through the route -- the numbers landed unreadable over the artwork and
the deck published clean.

What is flagged is not copy over decoration, which the template does itself: a
cover sets its title over its own photograph, and that is the design. The template
says where it means copy to go, in the placeholders it provides. So the finding is
copy that lands on the art *and* outside every one of them -- the part of the page
the template kept clear.

Declared geometry rather than the render, so this works on a machine with no
LibreOffice. A wrapped line reaches lower than its box says, which makes this the
lower bound: what it reports is real, and it will miss a line that grew.
