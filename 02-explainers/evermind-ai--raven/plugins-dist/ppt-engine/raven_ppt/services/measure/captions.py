"""What a caption nobody's source wrote is claiming.

A figure arrives with up to two captions and they are not the same kind of claim.
`ppt_ingest` records the one the figure's own source printed under it: evidence,
which a page may quote and credit. `ppt_figure_inspect` writes a second one by
looking at the pixels: a reading, which a page may describe and must not credit.
Downstream read `caption or visual_caption` and could not tell them apart.

This reads them back apart. Two states are reported, and both are shapes rather
than judgements about wording -- deciding whether a sentence is *true* of a
picture needs a model, and a check that fired on a paraphrase would be firing on
taste:

* an inspected caption asserting a name this deck's materials never mention. The
  run that motivated the check captioned a marketing banner as the architecture of
  a system called SkillCorpus; the word appears nowhere in the 95KB of materials
  that deck was built from, and the page then credited the picture to a product;
* a pair whose two captions name different things, which is the disagreement worth
  a reader's second: the figure's author called it one thing and the inspector
  called it another.

The name a caption "asserts" is deliberately narrow -- see `_names`. Ordinary
capitalised prose is not a name, so an English caption's first word cannot fire
this, and a Chinese caption still carries a latin product name intact.
