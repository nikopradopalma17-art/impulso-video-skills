"""Whether the words can be read off the ground they were rendered onto.

Every other check here asks about geometry -- is the box big enough, do two boxes
overlap, is the type above the floor. A live deck cleared all of them and still had
pages a reader could not use: its page 9 set the title in #1A1A1A on #000000, and four
of its labels in #1A1A1A on #1A1A1A, the same colour exactly. Page 12's title was
#1A1A1A on black too. Nothing measured it.

The cause is one confusion, and naming it is most of the fix. A deck's theme carries
`background`, `surface` and `foreground`; on a dark template those are black, near-black
and white. An author reaching for "the dark one" for its type picks `surface` -- which is
what the ground is painted with -- and the page comes out with black text on black.

Measured against the render, because that is the only place the ground has an answer:
what sits behind a text box is a layout's artwork, a photograph, a panel three shapes
down, or the master's gradient, and resolving that stack by hand reproduces the renderer.
The declared ink is read off the file, where it is stated exactly; the ground is the
modal pixel under the box, where the renderer has already resolved everything.

An earlier version segmented the crop into ink and ground by quantile and reported the
ratio between them. It flagged every page, and what it flagged were the commas: a `·` is
a few pixels wide, its crop is nearly all ground, and both quantiles land on the same
colour -- 1.0:1 meaning "no glyph here", not "unreadable".

Each finding also says who drew the shape it measured. "It came from the template's own
page, so it is the template's choice" is how a live author waved away a finding on six
chevrons its own program drew, and a refusal is where that excuse costs the most: which of
the two files the fix belongs in is a question only the files can answer. So they answer
it: cloning copies a prototype's shape positions exactly, so a shape sitting where a
prototype puts one, on a page that is that prototype's clone, is the template's, and a
shape sitting nowhere any prototype puts one is the program's. With no template to compare
against, the finding says nothing about it rather than guessing.

# WCAG AA asks 4.5:1 for body copy and 3:1 for large text, and 3:1 applied to everything
# is where this started. It refused a deck for its own template's design: the agenda page
# every deck is required to clone sets white numerals on the template's orange circles,
# which measures 2.5:1 and is perfectly readable -- a live run rebuilt that page five
# times and could not publish, because the only fix was to break the template.

# That was answered by splitting the check in two -- 2:1 refusing, and a 3:1 warning
# above it for type that is legible but thin -- and the warning is gone as well now.
# Measured, the 2-to-3 band is where template design lives rather than where mistakes do.

#
#   #FCFCFC on #50BBB6  ->  2.24:1   background on accent

# separates the two and only provenance does. The cost was never the noise: a live author
# met a real 2.2:1 finding with "the template's own accent1 color relationship, acceptable
# per spec note" -- about six chevrons its own program drew. A category that is usually
