"""Measurement of a built deck. Everything here returns `Finding`.

Two ground truths, never merged:

* the .pptx's declared geometry, for shapes the renderer will not move -- a
  picture, a filled panel, a hairline, a table;
* the rendered PDF's word boxes, for text, which the renderer reflows, so its
  declared position is where its frame was put and not where it landed.

Nothing here decides whether a deck may be published; it decides what is true
about one. Every finding it produces is a WARNING, because every one of them is
satisfiable by shrinking the copy, and a gate that refused publication until
they cleared could be answered by making the page worse (design doc D2). The
gates that do refuse a deck are provenance and design gates, and they live in
`services.gates`.
