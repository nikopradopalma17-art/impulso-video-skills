"""The defects every deck arrives with, fixed mechanically before anything reads it.

None is a mistake the author made, which is what they have in common and why they
are corrected here instead of being reported as findings. A finding asks the author
to fix something; these have nothing to fix.

*Empty placeholders.* A page started from a layout that carries a title placeholder
holds that placeholder whether or not anything was written into it, and an empty one
is not invisible: PowerPoint draws its frame and the words "Click to add title"
across it in the editing view, which is the view whoever receives the deck opens it
in. Measured on a delivered deck: ten of thirteen pages carried one, all at the same
(0.72, 0.14) 11.88x0.98in the template puts its title row at.

*Table styles.* `add_table` stamps every table with the Office gallery's "Medium
Style 2 - Accent 1" -- blue header, blue banding -- and python-pptx offers no way to
take it off. Every cell here is styled explicitly, so it should be unreachable, and
it is not: the style also carries the header's font and the cell borders, and
PowerPoint applies each of those wherever the cell itself is silent.

*Cell borders.* ECMA-376 fixes the order of a:tcPr's children -- lnL, lnR, lnT, lnB,
then the fill -- and a table built by a program that wrote them in another order is
not the format. LibreOffice does not check, so every render and every measurement in
this pipeline said four delivered decks had clean tables; PowerPoint does check, and
drops the properties it cannot parse, so the reader saw the gallery's blue table.

*Shape styles.* `add_shape`, `add_connector` and `build_freeform().convert_to_shape()`
stamp a `p:style` on everything they make, and its `a:effectRef idx="2"` names the
theme's second effect -- a drop shadow. `shape.shadow.inherit = False` does not take
it off: that writes an empty `a:effectLst`, and a renderer resolves the reference
separately from the list. Measured on a rendered page: every plane, rule, hairline
and mark came out with a grey shadow down its right side, and a deck of forty
rectangles that all float is the single loudest sign that nobody looked at the
render. This one *is* visible in a render, which is the only thing that sets it
apart from the others here.

The reference is zeroed rather than the element deleted, and both halves of that
matter. `a:effectRef` is one of the four children `CT_ShapeStyle` requires, so
deleting it alone is not the format; `idx="0"` is the standard's "no style", and it
is what PowerPoint itself writes -- 1044 of the 1048 `p:style` elements across the
ten shipped templates already say it. And deleting the whole `p:style` would not be
safe here: `template/compose.py` clones a template's own page into the deck, so a
slide-level `p:style` is not always python-pptx's stamp, and 1048 of them carry the
line, fill and font references the page is designed out of. The layout helpers do
delete the element, because every caller there sets all three explicitly; run over
a whole deck that is not known, so only the defect goes.

*Accidental outlines.* python-pptx's `LineFormat.color` getter converts the line to a
solid fill before it answers, so a program that only *reads* `shape.line.color` -- to
find a colour to recolour, say -- leaves `<a:ln><a:solidFill/></a:ln>` on every shape
it looked at, and a solid fill that names no colour renders as a default stroke: a
delivered deck came back with a thin blue box around every heading and body on its two
borrowed pages, and the second reader did not report them. No template writes that
element; a designer who wants a line names its colour.

Run over the whole deck rather than at the point each shape is drawn, because the
author writes the program: `table()` and `preset()` from the layout helpers get it
right, and a page that reached for `add_table` or `add_shape` directly gets the same
treatment.
