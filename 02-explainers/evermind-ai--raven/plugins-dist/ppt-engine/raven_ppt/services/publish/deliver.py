"""Taking custody of a built deck, delivering it, and keeping the record true.

The record has one job that is easy to state and was never checked twice: the
sha256 in `published.json` names the bytes under `out/`. It is written from the
digest the gates measured, on every publish, and it was right -- what moved was
the file. A live run's author, holding a delivered deck it wanted one more change
in, ran `python3 - <<EOF  # Apply the same fix to the published deck
(out/deck.pptx) in place` through `exec` at 08:14:18 and rewrote the delivery
where it lay; `deck/build/deck.pptx` and the staged copy both still held the
recorded bytes six minutes later, and the deck the user was handed had been
through no gate at all. So this module now reads the delivered file back rather
than trusting the copy it made of it, and says so when the two disagree.
