"""The second reader's findings, carried from one reading to the next until answered.

A reading used to live only in the reply that carried it. The author answered the
entries it chose and the rest were gone with the turn: on one 15-page live run the
reader named a paragraph buried under an illustration on page 14 at the twelfth
build, nothing answered it, and the deck was delivered three builds later with the
paragraph still buried. Nothing in the run ever said "page 14 is still open".

The ledger is that sentence. Every finding a reading reports is an entry with a
status: `open` until a later reading of the same page no longer reports it (`fixed`),
or until the author looks at the page and says why it stays (`dismissed`, with the
reason). The build reply lists what is open, and the list is the same list every
build until it is answered -- which is the whole difference from a reply.

Matching across readings is by page, kind and the words the reader used, because
the reader is a model and never says the same thing twice: "the paragraph under the
whiteboard" and "body copy hidden behind the illustration" are one finding. An
entry matched on a re-reading keeps its id and counts how often it has been seen.

It refuses nothing. The reader's list never blocked a build and the ledger does not
start to; it only keeps the list from disappearing.
