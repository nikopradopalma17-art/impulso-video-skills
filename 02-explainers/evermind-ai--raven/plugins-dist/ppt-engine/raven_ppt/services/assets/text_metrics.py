"""How wide a string really sets, measured through FreeType on the bundled fonts.

`measure.width` predicted this module: it owns the font-free estimator and says
"the real one loads TTFs through FreeType and belongs to the assets service, which
owns the deck's fonts. `WidthMeasurer` is the seam." The seam sat empty, the
estimator ran everywhere, and 1.4MB of DejaVu shipped with no consumer -- so every
width check ran on a deliberately conservative guess that reads narrower than the
truth and under-reports rather than inventing findings. Ported from the previous
engine's `text_fit`, where it was measured against the render.

Three rules, and the third is the one that makes it trustworthy:

* Latin runs go through PIL's FreeType binding on a real TTF.
* CJK is a full em per character, deterministically, because a CJK face is not
  bundled and a Han glyph is square in every face that has it. This is exact
  where guessing is not: a page of Chinese measured as 0.55em per character
  under-reports by nearly half, which is most of a deck in this fork.
* The answer is the *maximum* of that measurement and the export dialect's own
  estimate. The renderer's metrics are not the measurer's, and the previous
  engine calibrated the gap: LibreOffice 7.4 laid the longest repro line out
  0.14% wider than PIL at 26px. Taking the max means a string never measures
  narrower than what either party will draw.

Missing fonts raise rather than falling back to estimation: a measurement that
silently changes method is a measurement that silently changes verdict.
