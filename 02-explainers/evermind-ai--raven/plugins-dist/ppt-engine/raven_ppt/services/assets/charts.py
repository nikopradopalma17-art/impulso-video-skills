"""The chart forms, projected as a module an author's build script imports.

There was no chart of any kind on this route. `add_chart` was never reachable --
the runner deliberately withholds matplotlib and says so -- and what an author
did instead was compute rectangles by eye, one page at a time: a live run spent
four requests moving a bar it had drawn 0.3in too long because its own arithmetic
divided the box before it subtracted the axis. Every deck that wanted a
comparison either drew one badly or gave up and wrote the numbers as prose.

So the mapping from a value to a length is code. Every form here is axis-aligned
rectangles and straight lines over a single linear scale, which is what `Box`
already divides and what `write` already sets type in.

Twenty-three forms is a vocabulary and not a ceiling, and for a while it was read
as one: a page wanting a shape none of them make had nothing to reach for but the
nearest of the twenty-three, because the scales, the axes, the shade lines and the
label fitting under them were all private. They are public now. `rect`, `disc`,
`ring`, `hline`, `vline`, `poly` and `write_label` are the ink; `span`, `snap` and
`linear` are the scale; `series_paints`, `stack_paints`, `shades`, `emphasis`,
`ink_on` and `contrast` are the palette discipline the forms obey, so a chart an
author writes obeys the same one rather than inventing a colour. What is still
out of reach is an arc: a pie, a donut, a gauge and a sunburst want a sector at a
computed angle and no primitive here makes one. A filled polygon is not on that
list any more -- `poly(fill=...)` closes and paints one -- so a radar, a band and
a ribbon are drawable by hand, and the skill says which of them are worth drawing.

The first fifteen were the forms a page could not do without. The eight after
them are the forms eight delivered decks went without: 160 pages carrying two
charts between them, and the arguments the rest made -- a series that moved, one
figure reported four ways, twelve capabilities against two competitors, a run of
stages losing people, dated events with no duration, a spread with one slow
request in it, a whole divided into very unequal parts, segments of very
different size -- each had a shape, and every one of them was set as prose or as
a plain table because no primitive here would draw it.

They live in their own module rather than in `ppt_layout` for one reason: the
grid is read by every page and this is read by the pages that carry data. Folding
900 lines of scales and axes into the module an author opens to look up
`split_left` would make the common case pay for the uncommon one, and both are
read in full when they are read at all. `ppt_charts` imports the grid, so nothing
is duplicated -- the measurement that sizes a table's columns is the same one
that decides whether a value fits over its bar.

`raven_ppt.services.assets.script_helpers` writes this as `ppt_charts.py` beside
the script, next to `ppt_layout.py`. Coordinates are inches, for the same reason
they are there.

    from ppt_charts import column, horizontal_bar, waterfall
    from ppt_layout import page
    from ppt_theme import THEMES

    T = THEMES[next(iter(THEMES))]        # or by name -- ppt_theme says which
    frame = page()

           accent="East", unit="M")

Nothing here reaches for PowerPoint's chart object. A chart made of shapes stays
on the deck's palette, keeps the deck's face, and can be nudged by whoever opens
the file; `add_chart` arrives with Office's own six colours and its own
gridlines, which is as recognisable a tell as any stock template. It is also not
reachable on this route.

Every one of these obeys the same rules, so they are stated once here rather than
once for each below:

* **Length is the value.** A scale always contains zero, so a bar's length is
  proportional to what it says. `axis_max` only ever raises the top of a scale --
  it is there so two charts on one page can be read against each other -- and
  never truncates a bar. A value of exactly zero draws nothing; a value small
  enough to round away draws a sliver, because a bar that is not there reads as
  no data rather than as very little.
* **The label is on the mark.** Categories, values and axis ends are written
  beside the thing they belong to. The one construction that cannot do that -- a
  plot with several series in it -- gets a key of swatches, which is what a legend
  is for.
* **One thing is accented.** `accent` names what carries the page's claim, by
  index or by label (or several of either). It takes the theme's accent and
  everything else goes quiet in `muted`. Name nothing and a single series is
  drawn in `chart_series[0]`, the colour a theme reserves for the series a page
  is about.
* **Colour says which kind of thing it is.** Several bars standing side by side
  are several things, so they take `chart_series` in its own order -- it is
  spaced by hue and checked for colour vision. The parts of one stack, the roles
  of a waterfall and the two ends of a dumbbell are one thing divided, so they
  take depths of a single shade line instead. `chart_series` is ordered by
  prominence and not by lightness -- deep, mid, very pale, and round again -- so
  reading it in order for the second case comes out striped, which says
  "unrelated" about the parts of one quantity and loses the pale ones against the
  page.
* **Axes and baselines are hairlines**, under the thickness at which a filled
  shape stops being a rule and starts being a bar. There is no frame around a
  plot and no gridline that is not carrying a reading.
* **Nothing is invented.** These draw the numbers they are given. Where a value
  is missing the page has to say so; there is no placeholder here to pass.

`box` is a `Box` from `ppt_layout` -- inches, two corners -- and the chart fills
it. Give it a region out of the grid (`frame.body`, one of `body.rows(2)`) and
the margins, the gutters and the alignment come out right by construction.

There is no size, face or colour to pass. Type comes off the ramp in
`ppt_layout` and steps down one notch when a label does not fit, colour comes off
the theme, and the two together are what makes a deck of charts look like one
deck.

Every one of them hands back a `Drawn`. It *is* the plot's rectangle -- the box
left after the labels, the axis readings and the key have taken theirs, which is
the one region the caller cannot work out for itself -- and it carries two more
things: `where`, the chart's own map from a reading to an inch on that plot, and
what the chart had to give up to fit the box it was handed:

    drawn = scatter(slide, frame.body, T, points, axes=("Effort", "Impact"))
    drawn.names_not_written        # the points whose names had nowhere to go
    drawn.readings_not_written     # values the chart could not place
    drawn.marks_not_to_scale       # bubbles drawn at the floor, not to area
    drawn.type_pt                  # the step of the ramp its labels landed on

And every one of them can be asked before it is drawn.
`the_smallest_box_a_chart_needs` answers "how big does this have to be, with
*this* data" in inches, and `what_a_chart_will_do` answers the rest of it -- both
by running the chart against a slide that draws nothing, so what comes back is the
chart's own arithmetic rather than a second copy of it that drifts:

    room = the_smallest_box_a_chart_needs(column, T, rows)
    if room.w > cell.w or room.h > cell.h:
        horizontal_bar(slide, cell, T, rows)   # twelve categories, not enough width
    else:
        column(slide, cell, T, rows)

**And when none of the twenty-three is the shape of the argument, draw the shape
of the argument.** The twenty-three are shortcuts, not a ceiling and not a menu to
pick the nearest item off: the same base they are built on is public, so a form
that is not here is a page you write rather than a page you settle for.

    from ppt_charts import linear, rect, series_paints, span, write_label

    low, high = span(values)                       # a scale that contains zero
    at = linear(low, high, plot.y1, plot.y0)       # a reading -> an inch
    paints = series_paints(T, names, accent="Ours")

Ink: `rect`, `disc`, `ring`, `hline`, `vline`, `poly`, `write_label`. Scale:
`span`, `snap`, `linear`. Palette: `series_paints`, `stack_paints`, `shades`,
`emphasis`, `ink_on`, `contrast`. Fitting: `type_face`, `text_width`, `pick_size`,
`line_height`. Furniture: `key`, `scale_top`. Reading a value and writing one:
`number`, `fmt`. What a hand-drawn chart still owes the deck is every rule above
this line -- the scale contains zero where the mark is a length, the label sits on
the mark, one thing is accented, axes are hairlines, and the colour comes out of
`ppt_theme` through the palette calls rather than out of a string you typed. The
skill's `deck/build/references/charts.md` works one all the way through.

    and the key have taken theirs. That is the one rectangle the caller cannot
    derive, and it is what a second chart is aligned against or a note is hung off.

    On top of that:

    * `where` is the chart's own scale, as a function. `where(value)` is the inch a

    read against a second scale written down the right-hand side: revenue and the
    rate it grew at, volume and the share of it that converted, a count and a
    percentage. `sides` names the two scales over their own edges of the plot.

    Two units on one plot is the one case where a second scale is not a trick,
    and the way it stops being one is that both are written: the ends of the
    columns' scale down the left, the ends of the curve's down the right, so
    neither length nor position is a number the reader has to take on trust.

    The columns carry their own numbers inside their tops rather than over them --
    the air over a column is where the line is, and a number written into it
    belongs to neither. A column with no room for its number loses it to
    `drawn.readings_not_written`, and the top of the column scale is written on
    the plot so a length is still readable.

    `accent` names a column, by index or by label. The curve is the theme's accent,
    as `pareto`'s is: it is the second reading on the page and the one thing here
    that is not a length. Where the columns are already painted that colour -- a
    theme read off a template can have its accent and its first series paint be one
    colour -- the curve steps to the next series paint the columns are not using,

    and eats the air the even spacing had left it, and five marks in a 3.78in cell

    actually be set: `_em_width` of each of them, centred in the box it was slid

    still had a readable space in it, TEXT_INSET being margin rather than type.
