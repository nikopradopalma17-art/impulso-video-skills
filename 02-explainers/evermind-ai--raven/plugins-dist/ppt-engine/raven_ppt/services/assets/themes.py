"""Ten reviewed palettes, and the arithmetic to derive an eleventh.

A theme is the one deck-wide token set every page of a deck draws from, and it
exists so a deck is structurally unable to mix styles. What it carries is
colour, a font family, and three non-colour design choices (how the title sits,
what the decoration language is, how a structural page differs from a content
page). What it deliberately does not carry is a single number of points or
pixels: type size is measured against the page it lands on, not chosen with the
palette, and it is never a field a model can write.

Two ground rules the presets all obey, both learned from decks that read as
generated:

- Every page is white. The tinted plane a theme used to put behind the whole
  slide moved to ``surface``, where it separates cards and structural pages
  while the reading ground stays white. A deck whose every page carries a wash
  announces itself before a word is read.
- One accent, used for meaning -- markers, highlights, key numbers -- never for
  decorative bars or stripes. Cards separate through the ``surface`` tint plus
  a radius, never an edge bar.

``accent_soft`` and ``accent_soft_dark`` are pre-mixed low-contrast fills for
oversized background numerals and shapes. They are solid rather than a translucent
accent so that the fill is the same colour wherever it is used; the export does
carry alpha, and a drawing that wants a translucent layer asks `ppt_charts` for one.
