"""The assets, projected into modules an author's build script can import.

On the script route the author writes a python-pptx program, so there is no
schema to hang a theme field, an icon field or a shape field on. The assets reach
it as files instead: ``ppt_theme.py`` beside ``themes.json``, ``ppt_icons.py``
beside ``icons.json`` and ``icon_keywords.json``, ``ppt_shapes.py`` beside
``shapes.json``, dropped into the build directory where the script runs. The
script does ``from ppt_theme import THEMES, rgb``, ``from ppt_icons import
add_icon`` and ``from ppt_shapes import timeline``.

The keywords are a second file rather than a field inside ``icons.json`` because
the two are read by different code at different times: the geometry is walked
once per drawn icon and the keywords only when a name misses. Folding them
together would make every draw parse a hundred kilobytes of tags.

This module produces the *content* only. Creating the build directory and
writing the files there belongs to the script backend, which owns that
directory's layout and lifecycle; assets are stateless and touch no filesystem
of their own. ``script_helper_files()`` returns exactly what to write and under
what name, because the filenames are part of the contract -- the script imports
them by name -- and so they are not the backend's to choose.

The generated modules import nothing from raven. That is deliberate: the build
directory has to be readable and runnable as a plain python-pptx project, the
author reads these files to learn what it may draw with, and a script that
reached back into raven internals would break the moment those moved. They do
import each other -- ``ppt_shapes`` takes ``Box`` from ``ppt_layout`` and ``rgb``
from ``ppt_theme`` -- because they land in one directory and a second copy of a
colour converter is a second thing to keep right.

Icons are strokes on a 24x24 grid, drawn as freeform shapes so they stay vector
and editable after export. `colour` takes either a '#RRGGBB' string or an
RGBColor, so a theme colour goes in as it comes out of ppt_theme.

The ink is not the square you give it, and how much of it varies enormously:
`target` covers 75% x 75% of the box, `check` 62% x 42%, `minus` 58% x 0% -- a rule
through the middle with no height at all. So ask `the_ink_an_icon_covers` before
drawing and read `add_icon(...).box` after, and an icon sits on a baseline or flush
with a card's padding without a render to nudge it against.

`add_icon`'s `left`, `top` and `size` are EMU -- `Inches(0.4)`, not `0.4`. It is
the one call in this directory that is not in inches, and a bare `0.4` means four
ten-millionths of an inch, which would draw a shape that rounds to nothing at the
corner of the page; a size that small is refused. Every box either function
*answers* with is in inches, like every other box here.

`find_icons` searches the names and each icon's keywords, so a word that is in no
filename still finds something.

freeform would throw away.
