"""Colour arithmetic, so contrast is computed rather than asserted.

Every palette in this package was checked against WCAG by hand once, and a
palette the model seeds at runtime gets no such review -- so the same numbers
that were used to check the presets are what derive the runtime ones. That is
the whole reason this module is separate from the themes it serves: the
guarantee "body copy clears 7:1 on its ground" has to be a function, because a
theme assembled from a topic word cannot be reviewed by a person.

Paints are canonical uppercase ``#RRGGBB`` throughout, with no alpha anywhere in
this package: a tint is a pre-mixed solid colour. That is a choice, not a limit --
the export carries alpha and `ppt_charts` uses it. A token has to name the same
colour on every page, and a translucent one is a different colour over every
ground it lands on, which is not a token.
