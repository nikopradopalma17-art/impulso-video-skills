"""The Office preset shapes, and where a preset's points actually land.

Two rectangles is what this route could draw before this module: `RECTANGLE` and
`ROUNDED_RECTANGLE`, with `adjustments` touched exactly once in the whole
codebase. So every process, timeline and flow page came out as a row of boxes
with the arrows implied by whitespace, and the traces show what that costs --
an author computing a chevron's notch by hand, rendering, moving it, rendering
again. A primitive that is not there is a primitive the model simulates badly.

Preset geometry is the answer, and it has to be *preset* geometry rather than a
freeform tracing the same outline. `a:prstGeom` keeps the shape editable after
export, keeps its adjustment handles, inherits the theme, and carries its own
text rectangle -- a chevron's is inset past both points, which is the only
reason copy in a chevron does not sit on the arrow. A `custGeom` throws all four
away, and it would cost the measurements too: the geometry checks read a shape's
rectangle as the page states it, and a traced outline states a bounding box.

python-pptx knows the 177 preset names it can write and the default `avLst`
values each carries. It does not carry `gdLst` or `pathLst`, so it cannot answer
the one question that matters when placing one -- where does the point land --
and an author left to answer that arithmetically is the author the traces
caught. The answer is here: the normative guide formulas, evaluated.

Nothing in this module is physical. Widths and heights come in as whatever unit
the caller works in and every distance comes back in that same unit, exactly as
`icons` scales a 24x24 grid into whatever box it is given.
