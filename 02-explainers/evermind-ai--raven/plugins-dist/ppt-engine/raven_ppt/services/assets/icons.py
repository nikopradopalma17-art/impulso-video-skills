"""The packaged outline icons, and answering for a name that is not one.

The geometry is a data file, not a Python literal. Its predecessor was a
4197-line module holding one dict, which meant every icon change showed up as a
source diff, the import cost parsing all of it, and the licence scope pointed at
a ``.py`` file that was really third-party data. ``data/tabler_outline.json``
carries its own provenance and licence pointer; this module is the loader and
the lookup.

Lookup is deliberately forgiving about spelling and deliberately loud about a
miss. Upstream publishes these as ``map-pin`` and they are stored as
``map_pin``, so an author writing what it knows would otherwise be punished for
a separator. And a name outside the set entirely gets the nearest few back:
measured behaviour on the script route was an author trying ``category``,
``click``, ``arrows-move`` and ``switch-horizontal``, none of which exist, then
writing a script to bulk-replace them -- work that a list of candidates in the
error would have saved. An error that only says "no" costs a round; an error
that says "did you mean" costs nothing.

All four of those names now resolve, because the set they missed was a curated
180 out of an upstream five thousand. It is a curated thirteen hundred now, and
the wider set changed what a miss needs. A name is a poor index into thirteen
hundred names -- ``kpi`` is nobody's filename -- so each icon also carries the
upstream ``tags`` and ``category`` header as ``keywords``, and the search reads
them. That is what lets ``deadline`` reach ``calendar_due`` and ``inventory``
reach ``building_warehouse``, neither of which shares a word with what was asked
for.

Loader, lookup, and one measurement: ``icon_ink`` says how much of its square an
icon's strokes actually cover. That is geometry the data has always carried and
nobody could read -- see the function for what the spread turned out to be.

    times in the skill it had loaded and never once called.
