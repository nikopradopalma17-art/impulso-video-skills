"""The page grid, projected as a module an author's build script imports.

Three live runs wrote every rectangle by eye. What they produced was measurable:
labels needing 4.2in in a 3.0in box so they wrapped mid-phrase, copy painted over
copy, and body type pushed to 12.5pt to make invented boxes fit. And what a reader
saw was a page with no visible structure -- gaps of six different sizes, rows that
did not line up, nothing to separate one group from the next -- because nothing
shared a grid.

So the grid is code. An author asks a page for its regions and asks a region to
divide itself; the gutters are one number, the safe margin is one number, and every
box a program draws is as wide as the column it sits in. Zones become visible
because a region can paint itself in the theme's own surface tint rather than being
implied by whitespace the author eyeballed.

The type ramp is here for the same reason: a size chosen per page drifts, and the
floor the measurements enforce (14pt body) belongs next to the sizes rather than in
a document the author may not re-read.

`raven_ppt.services.assets.script_helpers` writes this as `ppt_layout.py` beside
the script. Coordinates are inches, because that is what python-pptx's `Inches`
wants and what the author reads in the reference.

Every box is inches: `box.pptx()` unpacks straight into python-pptx.
Never write a coordinate by eye -- ask a region to divide itself, and the gutters,
the alignment and the safe margin come out right by construction.

Ask before you draw, and read back after. `text_size`, `points_size`, `table_size`,
`picture_size`, `lines_needed`, `formula_type_size` and `fits` answer what a thing
will take while there is still time to place it, and
`the_largest_step_this_copy_takes` answers the other direction -- how big the copy
in a box is allowed to be, so a label in a 1.25in shape is not set at the smallest
step on the ramp; and every helper that draws hands back the box it really covered,
so the next thing down the page is `written.box.y1 + GUTTER` and never a number
tried against a render:

    down = stack(frame.body)
    title = write(slide, down.take(0.4), "结论", size=LEAD_PT, colour=INK, font=FONT)
    down.skip(GUTTER)
    grid = table_size(rows, T, box=down.rest())
    tbl = table(slide, down.take(grid.h), rows, T)
    write(slide, Box(tbl.box.x0, tbl.box.y1 + GUTTER, tbl.box.x1, ...), "来源：Table 2", ...)

The other end of that arithmetic: a run measured this way is as tall as its content,
which is rarely as tall as the body. Ask the page to hold it --
`page().holding(grid.h, GUTTER, group.h)` -- and the leftover becomes air above and
below the page's content instead of a band of white along its foot.

        commonest thing wrong with a delivered deck: eleven of eighteen pages of one run
        ended their content between 60% and 70% down, and the render measured 1.5in of
        trailing white on the worst of them. Nothing on those pages had asked for that
        height -- it was the room that was left.

        The leftover goes outside the run rather than between its bands. Between them is
        `stack(...).spread(...)`, which is what a lane of cards wants and what a page of
        groups does not: a whole page's leftover put into one gap is reported as a blank
        field in the middle instead of one at the foot.

        And not half above, half below, because a reader sees white and not regions. The
        white over the body is the `GUTTER` the page leaves under the heading, the white
        under it is `MARGIN`, so an even split still leaves 0.44in more at the foot than
        at the head -- and on the page this was written for, that difference decided
        whether the render reported a trailing field. The two are made equal instead,
        measured from the heading's edge and to the page's. A run with less slack than
        that difference sits on the safe margin rather than being pushed through it.

        What is under the body is what decides that, so a page that reserved the footer
        strip is the other case: the white under its body ends at the footer's hairline
        one `GUTTER` below it, which is the same `GUTTER` that is over it, and an even
        split already reads even. Correcting anyway lifted the run by the whole
        `MARGIN - GUTTER` -- measured on two reference pages, 0.44in more air above the
        run than below, which reads as content pushed down onto the foot.

        Because it moves the region and not a cursor, it answers for the page rather
        than for one lane: `columns`, `split_left` and a stack down each lane all come
        out of the same corrected band, so two lanes still end level. Where the lanes
        differ, the run to pass is the taller one.

        Not for a run something else is already spreading into the body: a
        `card_group(down=True)` handed the whole body puts the leftover between its own
        cards, so cutting the body to the sum of their heights first leaves them
        touching. Ask this where the page takes measured bands off a cursor, which is
        where the leftover has nowhere to go.

        Bands and gaps are the same thing here, as they are for `short_by` and `spread`:
        pass them in the order they occur, and a single list works too.

        is `take`'s to refuse, naming both numbers. Only the body moves -- the kicker,
        the title and the footer stay where the page put them, so this can be asked

# for Han at every size, against 1.155 to 1.173 for Latin. Charging 1.2 left each Han
# row 0.037in short at 12pt through 0.061in at 20pt, and a short row is not a cosmetic
# matter: the arithmetic the module hands back is then wrong about where the table

# labels, mixed lines, sentences, card bodies, chevron steps, table cells, in the
# six faces a theme may name. Measured off `pdftotext -bbox`, the ramp left a
# median 11.6pt of clearance to the nearest edge of the box it was asked about and
# put ink past an edge in 2 of 40; the same search over every integer left 5.7pt

    The other direction from `fits`, which answers yes or no at a size already chosen.
    Guessing instead of asking puts sizes off the ramp and type under the shape that
    holds it: a chevron label set at `LABEL_PT` in a shape 1.25in tall is a fifth the
    height of the thing it names, and the render is the only place that shows.

    So ask, and hand the answer to `write`:

        size = the_largest_step_this_copy_takes(label, step.box, font=F)

    Everything in a row shares one size or the row reads as five unrelated words,
    so ask for each and take the smallest -- the same `min` that levels a row of
    cards:

        size = min(the_largest_step_this_copy_takes(label, one.box, font=F)
                   for one, label in zip(steps, labels))

    `wrap` is the difference between a label and a paragraph, and it is the whole
    reason this takes an argument beyond the box: by default the copy stays on the
    lines you gave it -- one string is one line, a list of three is three -- so a
    four-character label in a wide shape is not answered by breaking it in half.
    Pass `wrap=True` for copy that is meant to reflow, a card's body or a band of
    prose, and the answer is the largest step whose wrapped block still fits. The two
    answers differ by as much as two steps, so the flag is not a detail.

    `align` and `anchor` are not arguments because the answer does not depend on
    them: a block of copy is the same size centred as it is top-left, and where it
    lands inside the box is `write`'s own answer to give back. What does depend on
    them is the air around it -- ask about the box the copy may cover, not the panel
    it sits on, and `box.inset(PAD)` is that box.

    `largest` is the step to stop at, and it is the author's to name because it is a
    decision about what the copy is rather than about whether it fits. The ramp is a
    set of roles -- kicker, label, body, lead, title, figure -- and this call answers
    the largest of them the copy still fits at, no further up than the one you name.
    A ceiling inferred from the copy is not offered: read off a character count, it
    calls `internationalization` a sentence and a fourteen-character CJK line with no
    spaces a label, so it caps a label and lets a line of prose come back at the size
    of the page's own title. A count of characters cannot tell those apart, and
    guessing wrong is worse than asking. Name `LEAD_PT` for a line that leads a band,
    `BODY_PT` for copy, `NUMBER_PT` when the copy really is the figure.
    `BODY_FLOOR_PT` means either that the floor is what fits or that nothing does --
    `fits(text, box, size=BODY_FLOOR_PT)` tells those two apart, and a False there
    wants a bigger box or shorter copy, not another build.

    python-pptx hands you the Office default, and the default is why tables come out
    looking cheap: a white hairline around every cell, banding on, and a header style
    that fights whatever palette the deck is in. On a dark page the grid is the loudest
    thing on the slide.

    So the defaults here draw the other kind: quiet lines at one weight, no banding,
    no filled column -- and the header on the theme's own `accent_soft`, because a
    header row separated from its data by a line alone reads as a fourth data row. The
    tint was a keyword away and a delivered deck's table was called ugly for not
    turning it: a default is what ships. The rule between the columns was off here too, on the
    reading that alignment already told one column from the next -- and that reading
    expired when every non-numeric column started being centred, because a centred
    cell has no visible edge to be centred against. `column_rules=False` takes it back
    off for a table read across one row at a time.

    **What every style does draw is a frame, a rule at every row boundary and a rule
    between the columns** -- the four outer edges in the theme's `muted` tone and the
    interior lines in the quieter `grid` one, all of them at `grid_pt`. That is a grid
    and it is not the Office grid: one weight and two quiet tones, with no banding
    under it and no blue header over it, where `add_table` gives every one of 25 cells
    a white hairline on a banded, gallery-styled table whatever palette the deck is in.
    Without the frame there are three lines that each end in mid-air -- a rule under
    the header, a hairline under the last row, and no side of any kind -- which reads
    as unfinished rather than restrained. Without the row rules a four-column
    comparison whose cells wrap onto two lines says nothing about where one row ends
    and the next begins, and the reader counts baselines to work out which cell belongs
    to which label. Without the column rules, on the rows a delivered deck shipped with
    every interior vertical written as noFill, a five-column table of figures read
    "2012" and "8" as one cell and a three-column table of phrases read as one run-on
    line. All of them are at `grid_pt` rather than `rule_pt`, so the
    accent rule under the header stays the heaviest line and the table is still read
    from it. A default is what ships, so the default has to be presentable with no
    keyword turned.

    **Those are defaults and not a house rule.** `column_rules=False` takes the line
    between the columns off, `fills` paints any cell, row or column in a colour you name,
    `banding` tints alternate rows, `align` sets each column's alignment by name,
    `header_size` sets the header's type independently of the body's, `rule_pt` and
    `grid_pt` set the two line weights in points, and `row_height`, `header_height`
    and `padding` set the rows' own measurements. A page whose table wants its columns
    left open, or its third column painted, should have it. And when
    what a page needs is not a variation on this table at all -- merged cells, a
    grouped header spanning three columns, an icon inside a cell, a sparkline down a
    column -- draw it out of `Box`, `columns`, `stack`, `lines_needed`, `write` and
    `plane` instead. `deck/build/references/tables.md` has that worked through; nothing here is
    the only way to put a grid on a page.

    `rows` is a list of lists of strings, the first being the header. **Alignment is
    read off the cells**: a column every one of whose entries is a figure is
    right-aligned, because a column of numbers that is not right-aligned cannot be
    compared down its length, and a column of prose is left-aligned. Right-aligning
    everything but the first column on the assumption that a table is labels and
    figures leaves a four-column comparison of sentences ragged down three left edges.
    `numeric_from` takes an index for a table the measurement reads differently, and
    `align` names every column outright. `style` is optional and applies
    to this table only: `header_tint` is the default and tints the header row,
    `minimal` takes that tint back off for a table that has no header to speak of, and
    `compact` reduces row padding for a dense lookup.
    `row_rules` is the fourth, and it is now the same table as `minimal`: the row
    boundaries it used to switch on are what every style draws, and the name is still
    accepted so that a script already passing it keeps building. `emphasize_rows` tints
    selected body-row indices when they carry the page's point.

    **Columns are sized from what they hold**, so a 22-character benchmark name gets
    the room it needs and a 4-character metric does not. Equal columns leave you
    shortening headers and guessing at `weights` to buy room the measurement already
    finds. `weights` is still there for a table that wants a column wider than its
    content.

    **A table spans the box it is given**, in those proportions. So the box is where
    you say how much room this table gets: hand it `frame.body` and it runs margin to
    margin like the heading over it, hand it one column of a `split_left` and it stops
    there. A two-column table of five figures does not want the whole page -- give it
    a column and put something beside it.

    Beyond the grid, five things a table has to be able to say. `emphasize_rows` and
    `emphasize_columns` tint the row or the column carrying the page's point in the
    same soft accent, so a table can name the one option under comparison as readily
    as the one criterion. `group_rows` is `{row: "name"}`: that row becomes one band
    across the table, in the theme's surface, carrying the group's name -- its own
    cells stay empty and never set a column's width. `indent_rows` steps a detail
    row's label in by one PAD and sets it in the muted tone, and `total_rows` sets a
    row bold under a rule in that same muted tone -- darker than the hairline every
    boundary already carries, which is what says the numbers above it were added up
    rather than merely listed.

    `fills` is `{(row, column): colour}`, and either coordinate may be None for "all
    of them": `{(None, 3): "accent_soft"}` paints column 3, `{(2, None): "surface"}`
    paints row 2, `{(2, 3): "#FFEECC"}` paints one cell. The colour is any role the
    theme carries or a literal, so a deck that stated `ours` once in its palette can
    fill a column with it. That is the difference from `emphasize_columns`, which
    picks the colour for you: use the emphasis where the page is saying "this is the
    one", and `fills` where the page is saying which colour.

    `marks` is `{(row, column): "kind[:value][:colour]"}`, drawn over the cell by
    `mark`: `harvey:3.5`, `status_dot:accent`, `delta`, `progress:76%`, `check`,
    `cross`, `partial`. A mark that needs a number and is not given one reads the
    cell's own string, so `{(3, 4): "progress"}` on a cell holding "76%" says it once.
    Row 0 is the header and takes none of these.

    **A row is as tall as the lines its cells really wrap onto**, counted at the
    widths the columns really get. A declared row height is only a floor: the renderer
    grows every wrapped row and each boundary below drifts down, so a rule drawn as a
    free rectangle at the boundary the arithmetic named comes down through a row's
    copy. The rules are the cells' own borders, so they move with the row whatever the
    renderer does with it, and the heights are measured so that it has less to do.

    **And the rows spread into the box** rather than leaving its bottom third white.
    `fill=False` keeps the table at the size its content asks for.

    Returns the table and the box it fills, which is as wide as its content wants, as
    tall as `box` where there is slack to spread into, and **taller than `box` when
    the rows need more than it gives** -- a row is never squeezed under the line in
    it, so the height is the rows' and not the box's. So the next thing on the page
    goes at `written.box.y1`, which is where this table really ends, rather than at
    the bottom of the box handed in. `table_size` is the same arithmetic, asked before
    the table is drawn: with the same `box` and the same keywords it answers this same
    height, taller box included.

    to hold, and the columns are sized from what they hold -- so where a table ends is
    an answer and not a build: `stack.take(table_size(rows, T, box=band).h)`.

    Takes what `table` takes, so the two calls sit side by side and cannot describe
    different tables -- `numeric_from` decides alignment rather than width and is
    accepted only so that the pair stay copy-for-copy identical, and `emphasize_*`,
    `total_rows`, `align`, `banding` and `column_rules` change the ink and not the
    geometry, so they are not here at all. `indent_rows` is, because a stepped-in
    label wraps in a PAD less room than its column and so can cost a line.

    **The frame is ink and not room.** A border is drawn on the boundary and not beside
    it, so it takes nothing from the row it edges: `grid_pt` may be raised without this
    answer going stale, and the frame's weight is not added to the height -- adding it
    would put the rows somewhere they are not.

    With `box`, the answer is placed at that box's top-left corner and the box is the
    room the table spreads into -- which is what `fill` does, and the height comes
    back as the box's own where there was slack to take. `fill=False` answers for the
    table its content asks for.

    **So do not ask this in order to decide how much of a region to give the table.**
    From five rows up the answer *is* `box.h`, and asking it about the whole body and
    then putting a band above the table is circular: the height came back for a region
    the table is not going to be drawn in, and `take` refuses it at the band where the
    room runs out. A live build failed four times over exactly this -- a 4.22in answer
    measured against a 4.67in body, drawn under a 0.62in band. Either hand `table` the
    band and let it fill it, which needs no measurement at all, or pass `box=` **the
    band the table will be drawn in**. `fill=False` answers what the content alone asks
    for, and that answer is a measurement and not a height to draw at: a table drawn at
    it sits in a band it does not fill. Measured on a live page, one five-row table came
    back 4.69in with `fill` and 1.77in without -- 62 percent shorter, in the 5.10in band
    it had been handed. So when something goes under the table, take that something off
    the region first and pass `box=` what is left, `fill` still on; asking without `fill`
    answers whether the content fits at all, which is a different question from where the
    table ends. Without a box it is a size at the origin and the
    table is as wide as its content wants -- and given `weights` are apportioned over
    that width, because proportions carry no width of their own. That answer is the
    one to build on: every column of a weighted table drawn in a box at least this
    wide gets at least the room measured here, so no row of it wraps onto a line this
    height did not count. A box narrower than that width is a table drawn taller than
    the height answered, and the columns squeezed under their own content are what
    `wide_table` reads off the built file.

    is a length, and lengths compare at a glance. Same for a share (a bar), a

    cannot set a cell's edges either -- which is why the row rules are shapes too;
    `_hairline` is the same construction. Shapes added after the table sit over it.

    `kind` is one of harvey, status_dot, delta, progress, check, cross, partial.
    `value` is what that kind reads, and the two readings are not interchangeable: a
    *rating* for harvey ("3.5", "3.5/4" for a four-step scale, or "75%" of whichever
    scale), a signed number for delta, and a *share* for progress ("76%", "0.76", "76"
    all mean three quarters). check, cross, partial and status_dot read nothing.

    "availability". A mark states the fact in the page's own ink, and the accent stays

        then ends on the region's own bottom edge, so two columns given the same
        region end level and the page has no band of white under it.

        For components and not for running copy. The gap between two cards is air;
        the gap between two paragraphs is a break in a thought, and copy spread down
        a region reads worse than copy left at the top of it. A copy column far
        shorter than its region is a page bigger than what it holds, which no cursor
        can fix.

        The commonest defect on a delivered deck is the other thing: eleven of
        eighteen pages in one run ended their content between 60% and 70% down and
        left the rest empty, and four more were two columns that stopped at different
        heights. Both are this call not being made.

        A run with no slack still gets `GUTTER`, which is the floor and not the
        share. This used to be the other way -- no slack meant the gap the cursor
        already carried, on the reasoning that the region cannot pay for more -- and
        a delivered page shows what that buys: three tinted panels down a column at
        1.24-3.16, 3.16-4.78 and 4.78-6.70in, 0.000in apart twice, reading as one
        block somebody forgot to finish rather than as three cards. The program that
        drew it was `stack(right).spread(*need)` with `need` already shortened to fit
        the region exactly, so the share was zero. Welding components is not a
        cheaper page than a shorter one, so the bands are what gives: with no room
        for the floor the run overruns and `take` says by how much. `card_group` has
        had this floor from the start, by passing `gutter=GUTTER` into the same call.

        One band has no between, so it centres instead. So it needs no guard around
        it -- `stack(box).spread(*heights)` is right whether or not there is slack,
        and a caller that adds its own `skip` overruns by exactly what it skipped.

    A title floating on the same white as the body leaves the page without one, and

    the title row gives every page the same anchor -- and because the band carries
    the title, it is grouping rather than decoration: the band gate reports a filled
    bar only when nothing sits on it.

    This is one way to give a page its top edge, not the only one. What a deck may
    not do is give each page a different one: the header is the element every page
    shares, so whatever form it takes, it takes the same form throughout.

    No rule under the title: an accent hairline repeated under every title is the most
    repeated mark in the deck and it carries nothing, which is the definition of the
    decoration this house style spends its warnings on. `rule` is still here for the
    dividers that do carry something -- a chart's baseline, a table's header.

    `bleed` runs the band the full width of the canvas, which reads as design; off,
    it stops just outside the safe area, which reads as a box. Returns the ground and
    its box, so a page that wants something at its right edge knows where the row
    ends -- `heading(...).x1` and `heading(...).box` are the same corner.

    `anchor` is where the title sits inside its row, and it is a parameter because a
    template decides it: anchored to the middle inside a template whose own title
    placeholder anchors to the bottom of its row, every composed title sits above every
    cloned one. The house style reports the template's answer as `title_row_as_code`;
