"""What this machine can actually do, asked before anything is promised.

The chain has one required link and two that come in pairs, and the difference
matters to a caller: without LibreOffice there is no PDF and therefore nothing to
look at or measure, while a missing PDFium only means the fallback binary does
the work. A tool that reports "previews unavailable" for the first case and says
nothing for the second is the goal, and it needs one answer object to do it.

The probe imports PDFium rather than only looking for it on the module path,
because a wheel whose bundled library cannot load is exactly the failure this
report exists to catch, and `find_spec` says yes to it.

# Held for the whole of every call into PDFium, by every caller, in this process.
#
# pypdfium2 states it in its own API contract: PDFium is not thread-safe, and two
# threads must not be inside it at once even for different documents opened through
# different wrappers -- it can crash or corrupt the process. So the serialisation
# cannot live on whatever object a caller happens to hold. `LocalDeckRenderer` is
# frozen and cheap to construct wherever one is wanted, `DeckViews` is made per stage,
# and `publish.trim` reaches the module without either; a limit on any one of them
# leaves the other two free to overlap with it.
#
# Measured on the path that found this: over a nine-template reference set, six of the
# nine PDFs failed to open with "PDFium: Data format error" while two rasterisations
# ran at once, every one of the nine opened when they were read one at a time, and an
# earlier run on the same path took SIGSEGV. `pages_of` answers a failed read with an
# empty dict, so the cost was a reference sheet quietly short of two thirds of its
# pages rather than anything that looked like an error.
#
# Reentrant because a region that holds it may call a helper in this package that
# takes it again, and the second take is the same thread rather than a second reader.
