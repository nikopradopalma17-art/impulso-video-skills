"""Everything read back out of the rendered PDF: pixels, page sizes, word boxes.

Two backends, in a fixed order. PDFium through `pypdfium2` is preferred because it
is in-process -- no subprocess, no argv, nothing to time out -- and because it
ships in the `ppt` extra, so it is present wherever the capability is installed.
Poppler's `pdftoppm` / `pdftotext` are the fallback for a machine that has
LibreOffice from the distribution but no wheels, which is the common shape of a
minimal container.

Both are converted into one convention, defined once in
`raven_ppt.contracts.rendered`: points, origin top-left, y downward. Poppler is
already there; PDFium reports text with the origin at the bottom-left and y going
up, and gets flipped here. Getting that flip wrong is not a crash, it is a
measurement that reads a page upside down and reports collisions between things
that are nowhere near each other, so the test suite pins the convention with a
deck whose text is known to sit near the top.
