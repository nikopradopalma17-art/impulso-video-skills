"""The one object the rest of the capability holds to see a deck.

Callers depend on `DeckRenderer`, the protocol, and are handed
`LocalDeckRenderer`, the implementation that shells out to LibreOffice and reads
the PDF in-process. The split is the extension slot: the predecessor's render
service could also drive a browser, normalise spreadsheets, capture motion and run
the whole conversion inside a container, and if any of that is ever wanted here
again it arrives as a second implementation of this protocol rather than as an
argument threaded through every call site.

**These calls block, for seconds.** LibreOffice on a real deck takes single-digit
seconds cold; rasterising forty pages takes a few more. A stage must therefore
reach them through `asyncio.to_thread`, not call them directly on the event loop --
an agent whose loop is parked for eleven seconds stops answering.

Threads are safe here, but only one half of the chain is safe by construction. Every
conversion is its own process with its own profile directory and its own temporary
space, and nothing in this package holds mutable state between calls. Reading the PDF
is the other half: PDFium keeps its state per process rather than per document, and
pypdfium2's API contract forbids two threads inside the library at once even for
different documents opened through different wrappers. So every call into it is
serialised by `capabilities.PDFIUM_LOCK` -- including from an instance of this class
that knows nothing of any other -- and a caller that reaches the module by some other
route has to take that lock as well.
