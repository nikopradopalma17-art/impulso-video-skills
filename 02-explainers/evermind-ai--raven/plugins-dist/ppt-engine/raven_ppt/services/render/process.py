"""Running a converter without leaving anything behind.

Every subprocess in this package goes through here, for one reason:
`subprocess.run(timeout=...)` kills the process it started, and `/usr/bin/soffice`
is not the process that does the work. It is a `/bin/sh` wrapper that execs
`oosplash`, which forks `soffice.bin`; killing the wrapper on timeout leaves
`soffice.bin` running, holding the throwaway profile directory open, and the
cleanup that follows races it. That is not hypothetical -- this machine was found
carrying an `oosplash` with PPID 1 from an abandoned test run days earlier, still
pointing at a profile path that no longer existed.

So: each call gets its own session, and a timeout kills the whole group.
