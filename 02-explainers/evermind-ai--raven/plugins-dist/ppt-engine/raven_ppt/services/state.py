"""What a deck has to work with, read off disk.

Counting, and only counting. Whether a set of materials is *enough* to make the
deck the user asked for is a judgement about content against intent, and nothing
here can make it -- that is the intake pass's question, and this is the input it
gets handed. The division is deliberate, because the two are not the same kind of
claim: a count cannot be argued with, so it is what a check binds to; a judgement
can, so it is recorded and acted on rather than enforced.

Cheap on purpose -- a few `is_file` calls and two small JSON reads -- because it
is asked on every build and again on every intake.
