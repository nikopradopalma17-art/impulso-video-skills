"""Working inside a template the user gave us.

The route's author writes a python-pptx program, so a template reaches it as
three things: a copy to build in, the code that drew its example pages, and the
operations python-pptx has no API for.

`prepare` gives the copy -- the same file with its example slides removed, so the
master, the theme, the layouts and the canvas all come across and a page added to
it inherits them. Every template in a sample of thirty ships example slides,
thirteen each, and an author that opens the original and starts adding pages
produces thirteen of somebody else's content plus its own.

`decompile` gives the code. This is the part that decides whether a template is
usable at all: measured on twenty real templates, 85% of their visual elements
live on those example slides rather than on the layouts -- 29 per template
against 5 -- so a page built from `add_slide(layout)` gets the placeholders and
almost none of the design. Reading the example page back out as python-pptx puts
the template's real geometry, colours and type in front of an author who then
writes its own page, and a six-card grid becomes an eight-card one by changing a
loop bound.

`compose` is the part the code cannot reach. Two thirds of real template pages
hold something python-pptx has no way to write -- custom geometry, a gradient, a
fill at 60% opacity -- so for those pages the only route into a deck is to clone
the page and edit it. That route is `clone_page` and then `replace_text` keyed on
the words the page holds now, one call per line, with `replace_picture` for its
figures and `drop_shape` or `remove_unit` for what is left over. Each is an
operation python-pptx does not offer and each has a way of going quietly wrong,
which is why they are here rather than in an author's program. There was a second
route, `adapt`, that took a whole page in one call and emptied every text frame it
was not given a value for; two doors onto the same page cost more than they
bought -- a live deck picked one, wrote a helper that assumed the other, and
shipped eight blank pages -- so only the copying one is left.

Two things were measured here rather than assumed, and both changed the design.
A master's or a layout's own decoration does not travel onto a slide, so the band
a corporate template paints across its header is invisible to every check that
reads the built `.pptx` -- which means using the user's template is not refused
for the user's own design, and also that such a band can sit under type nothing
will see it collide with. And a slot-and-capacity matcher was built here first
and then deleted: it bounded a deck at what the template's own pages happened to
hold, which is the opposite of what a program-writing author needs.
