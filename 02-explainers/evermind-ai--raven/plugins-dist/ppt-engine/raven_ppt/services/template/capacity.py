"""How much copy a template's box holds, said while the author is choosing the page.

`replace_text` keeps the prototype's geometry, and `compose._copy_fit` says so at the
end of the program -- after the copy has been written. This is the same measurement
one step earlier, on the template's own boxes, so that the number reaches the author
while it is deciding what to write rather than after it has written it.

The mismatch it exists for is measurable in the templates themselves. All ten bundled
templates are Chinese-authored and ship CJK example copy (`green_aurora_tech_trends`
4,438 characters, `black_circuit_tech_launch` 6,091), so their boxes are drawn for
full-width glyphs at roughly two Latin characters each. Of 351 heading-class boxes
(18-27pt) carrying real copy, 219 cannot hold 40 Latin characters even at the generous
bound. An ordinary English headline does not fit a Chinese template's heading box, and
before this the author was never told: the whole template reply measured 45,851
characters and contained the substring `chars` zero times.

Four rules the measurement imposes, each of them a thing this module says out loud:

* **A range, never a point.** The width measurer reads 1.10 to 1.30 wider than the
  render draws (`compose.MEASURED_WIDTH_OVERSHOOT` records both measurements), so a
  single number would be the measurer talking. The lower bound is the promise and the
  upper is where it stops being one.
* **The direction.** Resolved over the ten templates' 1,116 speakable boxes, the
  anchors are top 65%, centre 25%, bottom 10%: a quarter of all overflow grows past
  *both* edges and a tenth grows *up*, off the top of the slide. Ninety boxes are both
  bottom-anchored and too tight for 40 characters, so the dangerous direction and the
  tight geometry coincide rather than cancelling out.
* **Three outcomes.** Shrink (the shape's own `normAutofit`) 731, spill 201, and the
  frame growing itself (`spAutoFit`) 184 -- which is the majority behaviour on
  `gold_panel_year_end_summary`, 109 of its 177 boxes, with no `normAutofit` at all.
* **Only the boxes it can speak for.** A size read off a run is a fact; a box that
  states none anywhere is not measured and gets no band. Where the inheritance chain
  answers, the band says the size is inherited, because a template's placeholder that
  declares nothing renders at a size its layout chose and `house_style` has measured
  that disagreement at 24pt declared against 28pt drawn.
