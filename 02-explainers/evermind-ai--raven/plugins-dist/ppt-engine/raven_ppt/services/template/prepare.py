"""Turning a template the user handed us into one an author can build in.

One operation, and it exists because of one measured fact: every template in a
sample of thirty ships example slides -- thirteen each, in all thirty. An author
that opens such a file and starts adding pages produces thirteen slides of somebody
else's content plus its own, which fails the page budget, leaves nothing mapping to
the first thirteen, and puts a stranger's placeholder text in the deck.

python-pptx has no API for removing a slide, so without this every author would
reinvent the same XML surgery, and get it wrong in the same way: dropping the entry
from the slide list without dropping the relationship leaves the part in the package
and PowerPoint repairs the file on open.
