"""One line per example page: what it is, and whether code can redraw it.

The template reference used to arrive as source and renders, and both are the
wrong grain for the decision actually being made. A live run asked for pages 1-6,
received 30,000 characters of python-pptx with the template's placeholder copy
still in it, and then wrote its own layout system from scratch: eight pages, every
one on the emptiest layout, `clone_page` never imported. Measured on that same
template afterwards: 9 of its 13 pages hold something python-pptx cannot write, so
redrawing them in code could only ever have produced a worse page.

A menu is the grain of that decision. Thirteen lines, each naming what the page
is for and what it costs to use, is what lets an author say "page 5 is my metric
row" before reading any code at all -- and it puts the 9-of-13 verdict in front of
them at the moment they choose, rather than in a footnote about the pages they
happened to ask for.

What a page "is" is read off the page rather than guessed: the layout it uses, its
first line of text, and how many text blocks, pictures, tables and drawn shapes it
carries. Those five facts identify a cover, an agenda, a section divider, a card
row and a table page unambiguously enough to choose between them, and none of them
is a judgement this module has to defend.
