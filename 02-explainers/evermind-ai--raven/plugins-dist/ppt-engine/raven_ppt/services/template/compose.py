"""Building a page out of one the template already drew.

A template's visual elements live on its example slides and not on its layouts, so a
page built with `add_slide(layout)` gets the template's placeholders and almost none
of its design: covers come out right, because covers are decorated on the layout, and
content pages leave the template entirely.

The operations here are the ones that let an author work the way the design
actually supports: take the example page closest to what this page has to say,
replace its words and its pictures, clear a space in it for something of your own,
delete what is left over. Each is something python-pptx has no API for, and each
has a way of going quietly wrong that a reader of the resulting file would not
connect to its cause:

Cloning copies shape XML that refers to relationships by id. The new slide has no
such relationships, so every picture on the copy resolves to nothing -- verified:
`no relationship with key 'rId4'`. The references have to be re-pointed as the copy
is made.

Replacing a picture by deleting the frame and adding a new one loses the crop, the
outline, the shadow and the z-order the template chose. Swapping the image behind
the existing frame keeps all of it.

Replacing text by assigning to `.text` discards the run properties, so a heading
comes back at the body size in the body colour. Writing into the first run and
clearing the rest keeps what the template set.

Drawing into a cloned page means clearing a space in it first, and for a while
there was no way to say that here. A live program wrote its own two sweeps
instead -- one keyed on whether a shape's text was Chinese, the other on whether
the shape was bigger than 1.0x0.7in -- and against the page it ran on those kept
every arrow, every number label and, because a rule has one zero dimension, every
connector; two charts came out drawn on top of them. `clear_region` is that
operation, and it names what it took.

    """Swap the image behind a picture frame, keeping the frame.

    Deleting the frame and adding a new one is the obvious way and it loses what
    the template chose: the crop, the border, the shadow, the position in the
    z-order. The frame is the design; only the pixels are the content.

    A template's frame is almost never the aspect ratio of the figure going into it, so
    something has to give, and which one matters:

    * `fit="contain"` (the default) shrinks the frame to the picture's proportions and
      centres it there. The whole figure is visible.
    * `fit="cover"` keeps the frame exactly and crops the picture to it. Right for a
      photograph, wrong for a figure: a 3x3 grid of qualitative results went into a
      portrait slot under cover and lost its left and right columns, which is citing
      evidence the page does not show.
    * `fit="stretch"` distorts to fill, which is visible in any screenshot with type in
      it. There for the rare frame drawn to the picture.

    Contain is the default because on this route the pictures come from the sources --
    plots, tables, qualitative grids -- and losing part of one is a provenance problem, not
    a layout one. Reach for cover when the picture is decoration.

    Three arguments decide *which* pixels a cover fit keeps, and without them an author
    wrote its own swap: thirty lines of PIL and hand-edited XML, past the checks here.

    * `anchor` is the side the crop keeps -- "centre" (the default), "top", "bottom",
      "left" or "right". A photograph whose subject is along the top loses it to a
      centred crop: `anchor="top"` keeps the lettering on the archway.
    * `trim` cuts shares off the source's own edges *before* the fit, as
      (left, right, top, bottom). A screenshot with a progress bar along the bottom is
      `trim=(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`, and nothing has to be written to a file to do it.
    * `zoom` is a multiple of the scale that just covers the frame, so `zoom=1.6`
      shows 1/1.6 of what the fit would -- a detail made legible at the size the frame
      has. Under 1 is refused: a cover that does not cover is `fit="contain"`.

    `trim` applies to contain as well, where it cuts the source and the frame then
    gives way to what is left. `anchor` and `zoom` are cover's own and are ignored
    there -- contain shows the whole picture, so there is no window to place.

    `alpha` washes the new picture to a share of itself, the way `backdrop` does. It
    is for the frame that is the page: six of the eight bundled templates keep a
    picture the size of the canvas on a layout, a soft texture the type reads over,
    and a photograph swapped in at full strength drowns every title on that layout.
    `alpha=0.1` keeps it the texture the template meant; the shares between 0.12 and
    0.80 are the fog `washed_backdrop` reports, and a photograph meant to be seen goes
    in at full strength under a plane of ink with light type, as `backdrop` lays them.
    `None` leaves whatever wash the frame had.

    `box` -- (left, top, width, height) in inches, or a `ppt_layout.Box` -- reshapes the
    frame first, as `place` would, so the fit is computed against where the figure goes.

    A template's illustration is not always a picture: the cartoon on a section page is
    as often a group of a dozen freeforms, drawn in PowerPoint, and there is no blip to
    swap. Handed such a shape -- or a list of shapes that make one drawing -- this puts
    a picture where the drawing was: the drawing's own box (or `box`), the drawing's
    place in the z-order, fitted the same way, and the drawing removed. A shape inside a
    group takes the drawing it is part of with it -- the outermost group around it that
    holds no text, so a cartoon goes whole and the card it decorates stays. Returns the
    new picture frame on that route, so the caller can still reach it; `None` when a
    frame was kept.

    are placeholders. Full-bleed by default, or into `box` -- (left, top, width, height)

    16:9 page loses its top and bottom rather than stretching; `anchor`, `trim` and
    `zoom` place the window the way `replace_picture` does.

    The default is the form that reads: the photograph at full strength, a plane of the
    theme's ink over it at `scrim` (0.62, measured against a reference cover that works --
    a night market at full strength under a dark plane, white title), and every run of type the plane covers set

    photograph washed to 30% on a white page under black type reads as fog -- a live
    cover and a closing page came out that way -- and this is the alternative that does
    not. `ink` names the plane's colour when the theme's is wrong for the picture.

    `alpha` is the picture's share of itself, and with `scrim=None` (or 0) nothing is
    laid over it and the type is left alone: that is the texture form, for a faint
    picture behind a template's own ground, and it wants `alpha` at 0.12 or under. The

    answers `takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given`. Groups are searched, since

    Assigning to `.text` drops every run property, so a heading returns at body size in

    a worse bug than a missing page because it looks deliberate.

    colour and one word of it does not. Without this a cloned page could not emphasise
    anything: the plain-string path puts the whole line in run 0 and deletes the rest,
    and one run carries one colour. Pass a list of sequences for several paragraphs.

    **The box keeps the geometry the template drew it with, and says so when the new
    copy needs more of it.** Nothing here moves, grows or re-sizes a frame: longer copy
    wraps to more lines in the same box, and where the box cannot show them the program
    is told at the end of its run -- how many lines the box shows, how many this copy
    needs, how many the copy it replaced took, and where the overflow goes (down the

    `keep` spares a shape by the words it shows, in `shape_saying`'s prefix reading, or
    by the `# [n]` ordinal a template reference prints: the heading and the source line
    of a page are usually inside the region an author wants cleared under them.

    What it leaves alone: the shape the box sits inside, because on a template that is
    the card the chart was drawn in and it carries the arrangement the page was cloned
    for; anything in a group the template flipped or rotated, which has no position to
    compare against; and anything a layout owns, which `drop_shape` refuses.

    Loud on both sides. The return value names every shape removed, and a shape that
    overlaps the box at all and was not removed is named in `left_standing` and in a
    warning -- because "it looked clear and it was not" is the failure this replaces,
    and the number that decides it (`share`, half by default) is one an author may
    have to lower once it has seen what stayed.
