"""The palette an author read off the template's own pages.

Everything else about a template is read from the file: the canvas from the
presentation, the fonts from the theme part, the ground from what the master paints.
Colour is the one reading where the file and the page part company, and not at the
edges. Measured over the sixteen templates that ship here, every one of them states
its second background as `#F0F0F0` or `#E7E6E6` and not one paints that colour on
any page it ships -- 0 of 16, over every solid shape fill in them -- while the accent
is the largest non-ground fill in eight. A palette derived from the declaration is
therefore a grey palette inside templates that are not grey, and every card, band and
title row on every page came out that grey because they all default to one role.

So the reading is taken where the pages are visible. `ppt_template` already returns a
render of each example page; an author that has looked at them can say what it saw,
and what it says is kept here for the deck's whole life rather than re-derived per
build. Nothing about it is checked against a bar: a palette naming a saturated plane
is not an error to refuse, because the ink written on that plane is chosen against
the plane when the shape is drawn. What is checked is that a role name is one of the
roles and a colour is a colour, since neither of those is a judgement.

# The roles the derivation knows how to finish. Naming one of these replaces what
# would have been derived for it; naming anything else adds a colour to the deck, and
# both are stated the same way because to a page they are the same thing: `plane`,
# `card` and `heading` resolve a tint as `theme[tint] if tint in theme else tint`, so
# a role an author invents is a tint like any other.
#
# There is no closed list of role names, then, and the reason is what a page cannot do
# without one. A page is written one call at a time, so the compare-pair a deck sets
# up on page 3 -- `ours` against `theirs` -- does not exist in the script for page 4
# unless something carries it, and the only thing that carries anything between pages
# is this file. A vocabulary of eight would have made the four colours that deck
# actually uses expressible on one page and inconsistent across twenty.
