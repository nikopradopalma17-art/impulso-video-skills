"""A template page, written back out as the python-pptx that would draw it.

This route's author writes a program. So the honest way to hand it a template is
not a set of slots to fill -- that bounds the deck at what the template's own pages
happened to hold, and a template drawn with six cards cannot then be used for eight
points. It is to show the author the code: here is exactly how this design places a
title, what its accent colour is, how wide its cards are and how far apart, in the
form you write in. Then the deck's pages are written, not filled, and adjusting a
six-card grid to eight is a loop bound rather than a mismatch.

What comes out is deliberately flat and literal. Groups are opened, inherited
properties are resolved to the values they resolve to, and every number is written
in inches rather than EMU -- because it is read by someone deciding what to keep,
not executed as-is. It is a reference, and a reference that hides its numbers
behind indirection is worth less than the render beside it.
