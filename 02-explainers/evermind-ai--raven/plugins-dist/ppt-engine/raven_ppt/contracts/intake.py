"""What the user asked for, read out of the one line they said it in.

A deck task usually arrives as a sentence. Sometimes it carries everything --
"给投资人做一份 15 页中文路演,材料在 ./papers" states the language, the audience,
the length and where the sources are -- and sometimes it carries almost nothing.
Either way something has to read it, decide what is already answered, and go and
get the rest. That reading is a judgement about content against intent, so it is
a model's to make; this is where its answer is written down.

The split that matters is between *stated* and *inferred*. What the query actually
says is recorded and binds the deck -- the page budget is checked against the
built file, the language against what the pages say. What the query does not say
is a question for the user, never a guess: a budget nobody agreed to is worse
than no budget, because the deck then fails a check the user never set.

What comes out is a work list, not a verdict. "Are these materials enough?" looked
like the question until it was written down: on a first pass the answer is always
"go and get more", and a judgement with one possible answer is a step in a
process rather than a decision -- it costs a model call to say what was already
known. So this reads the task and says *what to get*, which is a judgement with
many answers, including an empty one when the sources already carry the deck. That
empty answer matters: figures here are extracted and never generated, so a deck
whose imagery came off the web has a surface on which a figure can be invented,
and filling that surface unasked would be the wrong default.

The plan is fingerprinted against the inputs it was made from, so it goes stale
when a document arrives and does not go stale because the deck was rebuilt.
