"""What the deck is for, as agreed with the person asking for it.

Three questions the author cannot answer from the materials, because the answer
is not in them: what language the audience reads, who the audience is and on what
occasion, and how long the talk is. A paper is written in English and presented in
Chinese; the same results become a fifteen-minute conference talk or a
five-minute internal update; and "16-20 slides" is a constraint from outside the
paper entirely.

The reason they are a contract rather than three prompt sentences: an agreed
decision that binds nothing is prose. The page budget is checked against the built
deck, the language is checked against what the pages actually say, and what the user
ruled out is quoted back on every build. Anything here that could
not be checked has no business being confirmed with a user -- it would ask them to
decide something and then ignore it.

    is replanned -- on the outline it would be rewritten by the next `ppt_outline`
    call and the deck would quietly regain the thing the user ruled out. It is not a
    property of one page either: "no icons" is a statement about the deck.

    Structured rather than left inside `notes`, because of how it binds. A rule
    agreed once and never said again is a rule nothing is holding: this route has
    already shipped that mistake, in the icon and theme summaries written for
    "callers who cannot see the catalogue" and then never injected anywhere. So
    `ppt_build` quotes these lines back on every build, which is the same way
    `audience` binds -- by reaching the call that would otherwise decide without it.
