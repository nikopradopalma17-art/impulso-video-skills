"""What the deck argues, page by page, before a line of it is drawn.

The route had no such stage and it showed. An author went from the materials
straight to a python-pptx program, so what each page said was decided while its
geometry was being typed -- and the decks that came out were thin: eight pages
carrying a title and three short lines each, with nothing having ever asked what
the audience has to believe by the end.

Deciding that is the deck's one genuinely creative act, so it belongs to the author
rather than to a pass that runs from code. What belongs here is the part that can be
checked, and two things can:

A figure the plan means to place has to exist in the catalogue. And the page count
meets the brief's budget now, rather than after eighteen pages of program have been
written against a budget of ten. What a page *says* is not checked against anything:
the gate that held a number in the outline against an index of the materials was
deleted with that index (design doc D3a).

The fourth thing it does is not a check: a page that names what it still needs turns
into a search. This is the moment when what the deck is missing is actually known --
`ppt_prepare` has to guess it before anything knows what the pages are.
