"""Turning the sentence a deck task arrived as into a project ready to build in.

The front of this route used to be four separate asks -- record the brief, bind
the template, fetch the sources, ingest them -- each described in its own tool and
sequenced by whoever was reading them. Asked for in prose, they did not happen in
order. And the sequencing is unnecessary here, because once the task has been read
every one of those steps is mechanical. Reading the task is the only judgement, so it is the only model call,
and the rest of this runs from code off its answer.

Two details of the order are load-bearing.

Everything that arrives becomes part of the deck's own source set, and the ingest
reads that set. Three arrival paths meet here -- a directory the user already has, a
file they attached, and the request text when it carries the substance -- and a
fourth, the fetch, meets them later. They used to be handled one at a time against a
single directory, with rules about which one won, and the rules were wrong: twice in
live runs the source the *user supplied* left the deck's evidence while sitting on
disk, because something else was ingested afterwards.

The user's directory is found by what is in it rather than by what it is called. A
name convention was the first answer -- ingest `materials/` -- and it misses
`papers/`, `素材/` and every other name a user picks. What identifies the materials
is that they are documents, so that is what is looked for, and only when exactly one
directory holds any: two is the case the model is needed for.

It is mirrored rather than copied once, so their directory stays authoritative for
what came from it, removals included. An attachment is not mirrored: it arrives under
a media cache outside the workspace, where nothing that walks the workspace can find
it and where the containment rule that refuses a model's invented path would refuse
it too -- and it did not come from a model, it came through the harness's own gate
because a person sent it. A `.pptx` among them is the house style rather than
material.

The ingest runs *before* the model is asked, because the call's real question is what
this deck still needs. Asked blind, it produced an errand reading "extract the text
and figures from the document in papers/" -- work already done by the time the errand
was recorded.

And the three fields the brief binds -- language, audience, length -- are turned
into questions *by this code* when the task does not state them, rather than left
to the call to remember. They gate the build, so a call that forgot one would
strand the deck behind a refusal with nothing telling anyone what to ask.

    Nothing here knows what the deck argues yet -- there are no pages -- so
    "find some pictures" is a question with no target, and it answers itself:
    one live run took two logos and a marketing banner, which made `state.figures`
    non-empty and the errand satisfied, while the material cited a paper whose
    figures carry their own captions and two benchmark posts nobody swept. Which
    picture a page needs is `ppt_outline`'s question, asked per page against a
    plan; this one only establishes what there is to choose from.

    Suppressed by the figures and by nothing else now. It used to stand down when any
    of the model's own errands had "image" anywhere in its `how`, which is a substring
    of `web_search(kind="images")` -- so an author that mentioned a picture search in
    passing, for one page, deleted the errand asking it to sweep the sources. The
    errand it deleted is the one thing said about the sweep before `ppt_outline`
    refuses over it, and two errands about pictures cost a reader a sentence.
