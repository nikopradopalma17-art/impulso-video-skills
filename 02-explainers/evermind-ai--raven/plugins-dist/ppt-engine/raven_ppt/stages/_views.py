"""Turning a built deck into things a model and a measurement can read.

Three concerns the render service deliberately does not hold, because they are
about a caller's budget rather than about rendering:

Concurrency. LibreOffice takes seconds and holds a profile directory; the service
is stateless by design, so the limit lives with whoever is asking. Without one, a
review of a twenty-page deck starts twenty conversions. How many is a fact about
the box rather than about the deck, so the number comes from
``render.default_concurrency`` and only an operator's own setting overrides it.

Blocking calls. The chain is synchronous -- subprocesses and Pillow -- so a stage
inside an event loop has to hand it to a thread or it stops everything else for
the duration.

Byte budget. An image reaching a model is base64 in a request body, and a
1920x1080 page render is 230KB to 1.1MB as a PNG, the top of that range being the
dark photographic pages. Twelve of those is a request no gateway accepts, so the
picture is JPEG by the time it is encoded, then downscaled if it still does not
fit, and both the format and the budget are stated once here rather than guessed
at each call site.

And one concern the fork's host used to hold: page identity. The fork's loop
kept each render's label beside it when an endpoint refused tool-role images
(its ``labelled_images``); the trunk loop's demotion moves the pictures alone,
so a page's number has to survive inside the picture. ``data_uri`` takes an
optional ``label`` and paints it on a strip added BELOW the page -- the page's
own pixels are untouched, so the second reader and the measurements judge the
same page the author built, and the strip reads as apparatus rather than as a
mark on the page.

# A sheet is twenty pages, so it is budgeted as twenty pages and not as one. The old
# 1_600_000 had no reader and would have been the worst possible number: measured, the
# largest template's sheet at four columns should carry 600px cells, and halving it to
# fit 1.6MB took it to 300px -- smaller cells than the same template gets on a sheet
# half the size, which is the one outcome a byte budget must not produce.
#
# Measured through this encoder on the eight bundled templates at 96dpi: a template's
# own sheet is 0.98MB to 1.57MB of base64, and the largest sheet the engine builds --
# the 36 borrowable reference pages at six columns -- is 2.50MB. So this is 2.4x
# headroom on the worst case, against the 7x MAX_IMAGE_BYTES gives a page render. A
# sheet always takes the JPEG branch, because the tiler composes in RGB and nothing
# downstream of it can see through.
CONTACT_SHEET_BYTES = 6_000_000
# How many pixels a sheet may reach before it is downscaled. `_IMAGE_TOKEN_CAP` is the
# right number for a picture whose subject fills the frame -- past it the patch count is
# clamped and the extra pixels buy no detail. A sheet's subject is one cell, a twentieth
# of the frame, so the cap has to be reckoned per cell: clipping a sheet's long edge to
# 1568 leaves 232-523px cells, which measures 82% top-1 against 90% for the same sheet
# at four columns and a 3072px edge (and against 90% for twenty separate renders). The
# number is `sheet.DEFAULT_MAX_EDGE`, imported rather than restated so a sheet the tiler
# was willing to build is never a sheet this encoder shrinks.
CONTACT_SHEET_PIXELS = sheet.DEFAULT_MAX_EDGE

# What the model is handed, and the quality it is handed at. A page render is a
# picture of type, so the quality was chosen on whether small copy survives it and
# not on a size target: measured on real pages at 1:1, 96dpi CJK body copy and
# white type on a saturated fill are indistinguishable from the PNG at 85, while 75
# visibly softens the same strokes. `_compressed` leaves chroma unsubsampled for the
# same reason -- these pages are coloured type on coloured fills, where 4:2:0 puts a
# fringe on every stroke and dulls a one-pixel accent rule. Over 97 pages of five
# real decks that is 2.5x fewer bytes than PNG, 4.6x on the dark photographic ones
# whose page renders made a 16.8MB request; it also keeps a dark page under
# MAX_IMAGE_BYTES, which as a PNG it missed by enough to be halved twice and reach
# the model at 784x453.
#
# This is the model's side only. A measurement reads the renders `pages_of` writes,
# which stay PNG: `measure.contrast` opens them to decide ink against ground,
# `render.pdf._unusable` counts their colours, `template.theme` samples them for the
# ground, and `render.sheet` composes them. No measurement goes through `data_uri`.
