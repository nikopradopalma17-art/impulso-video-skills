"""Build the deck, measure it, deliver it.

The order is the argument. Build, then measure the *file* rather than the
submission -- what an audience sees includes whatever a helper composed on the
way. Then publish, or refuse.

There was a stage between the measuring and the publishing: a design pass that
rendered each page onto an empty context and rewrote the block that drew it. It
is gone, and the iteration it stood for now happens where the author is. Every
build hands back the renders, so the author looks at the page it just wrote,
edits the program and builds again -- which is the same loop with one fewer
actor in it, and the actor removed was the one that could see the page but not
change what it said.

One refusal is not about the deck's content at all: a page whose code has never
been rendered back to the author. Every tool description here says to look at every
page and none of it was enforceable -- publication happens below, before the renders
are even fetched, so `slides=[1]` on an eighteen-page deck shipped seventeen pages
nobody had seen. What is recorded is that the tool handed a page over, which is the
closest thing to attention that exists, and it is keyed on the code that drew the
page so that editing one makes it unseen again. Skipped when the machine cannot
render at all: refusing a deck for a missing LibreOffice would be refusing it for the
machine rather than for itself.

Warnings ride along at every step and never stop the deck. Type size, overflow
and overlap are all satisfiable by shrinking the copy, so a gate that refused
publication until they cleared could be answered by making the page worse -- and
the loop then oscillates instead of converging, ending with no deck at all. They
are reported instead, all of them to the author, who owns the program and can
answer any of them.

One thing here is neither a finding nor a warning. A twenty-page deck is written
in one program and reviewed three pages at a time, and nothing told page 15 what
page 3 decided: with a template bound the author is handed the template's measured
house and held to it, and with no template there was nothing at all. So the built
deck is measured against itself and the answer travels back as a note -- the box
its pages put a title in, how many of them agree, the sizes its body copy comes
out at. Not a finding, because the deck it would fire on is the deck that has a
divider, a hero number and a closing in it, and those are meant to look different;
what is reported is the count, and the author reads it and decides.

# carries. The effective number is the stage's field, set from `tools.ppt.viewsPerCall`,
# and `ppt_build` reads it off the stage rather than keeping a constant of its own.
# That is the whole point of one number: the unseen record is written from the pages
# the stage decided to show, so a `slides` cap that disagreed either forbids pages the
# reply would have carried or lets a call name pages the reply silently drops.
# Three is a compromise between two measured failures. Twelve renders in one reply read
# as a batch to skim -- a run voiced one problem while several stood -- and one render
# per reply makes a nineteen-page deck nineteen builds to look at once, which is most of
# why a measured run spent 147 iterations.

# selects first. Larger than BATCH_VIEWS because of what the smaller number cost once
# the deck was written: a measured run reached twenty pages and then spent ten more
# builds on nothing but looking -- seven pages had changed since they were shown, so at
# three a call the unseen_page refusal came back three times with the deck otherwise
# finished. Six is under the twelve that read as a batch to skim, and turns that tail
# into two builds.

# A plurality of pages is not a majority of them, and the difference is where this
# measurement goes wrong. `_rows` answers for every page, so pages with no title in
# the band still vote and their answers cluster: on one deck three of six named a
# right-hand panel, on the same deck four of nine did (a 4-4 tie broken by insertion
# order), and on another two of five named a 16.5pt line. Every one of those is at or
# under half. Where the row really is the deck's, sixteen of nineteen said so. So the
# record names a row when most of the content pages put one there and says they have
# not settled on one when they have not -- a relation rather than a count, true at any
# deck length, and a tie falls out of it for free.
