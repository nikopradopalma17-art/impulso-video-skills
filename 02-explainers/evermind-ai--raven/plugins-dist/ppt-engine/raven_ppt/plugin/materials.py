"""Getting source documents in, and verifying the finished deck came out.

This was the fork launcher's job first and its ACP layer's second
(fork ``raven/acp/materials.py``, ported here with its behaviours intact): read
absolute paths out of the task text, copy them into the session's
``materials/``, append a listing to the prompt, and afterwards search ``out/``
for the deck the run published. Here the seat is the plugin's turn hook -- the
``before_user_inbound`` phase stages and rewrites the model's view of the
inbound text, ``after_send`` verifies and announces -- and the working
directory the copies land under is the turn's own (``workdir.current()``),
which the host binds per session.

What it can trust, inherited from the fork move onto ACP:

* The prose scan is kept. A dispatching agent still writes paths in prose, and
  the fenced-JSON block is still the reliable channel -- a path in prose is
  delimited by whitespace, so ``/tmp/my deck.pptx`` splits in two.
* The wrap-repair in the deck search stays gone. It existed for a console that
  hard-wrapped the announced path across three lines; on this host the reply
  is model text, and nothing wraps it.
* Searching the directory rather than parsing the announcement is kept anyway.
  A build writes intermediates beside the deck, so the announcement is what
  *chooses between* candidates -- and only this turn's writes are candidates,
  because a session's directory accumulates every turn's decks.

One fork function does not board: ``deliver()`` copied the finished deck from
the job directory to the ACP client's ``cwd``. On this host the turn's working
directory IS the delegating conversation's directory -- the deck is already
where the client looks -- so the copy has nowhere left to carry anything.
