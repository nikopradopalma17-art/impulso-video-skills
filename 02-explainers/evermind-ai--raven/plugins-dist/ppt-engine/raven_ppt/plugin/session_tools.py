"""The deck tools re-seated from per-process construction to per-turn address.

The fork built one engine per ACP session (fork ``raven/acp/engine.py``)
because every ppt tool takes its workspace at construction and
``Project.root`` fences one deck inside it -- two sessions on one tool set
would build two decks over each other in one ``deck/``. The trunk host pools
one loop over many concurrent sessions and answers the same problem with the
workdir cargo: ``session/new`` binds a session's directory into its metadata,
every turn body runs inside ``workdir.bind(...)``, and each consumer takes
``workdir.current()`` per call -- the same seam the built-in filesystem, shell
and media tools read (ppt verdict, feature 13).

So the registered face of each deck tool is a :class:`SessionTool`: schema and
name come from a prototype built once at activation, and each call resolves
the bound working directory and forwards to the real fork tool assembled for
that directory. One assembly per working directory, cached for the life of the
process -- the fork's one-engine-per-session shape, minus the AgentLoop it no
longer needs to duplicate; custody follows the fork's own precedent (job
directories were never reclaimed).
