"""The deck ledger: what a compacted deck run must not lose, read off disk.

The host's compaction replaces the head of a long turn with a model-written
handoff brief shaped for code work (files read, commands run, test output).
A deck run's head holds two other things. The user's own words -- the brief
they typed, the answers they gave ``ask_user``, the feedback they sent between
turns -- are the deck's requirements, and a summary that paraphrases them is
a deck built to a paraphrase. And the deck's working state -- the outline, the
figures ingested, the reader's open findings, what was published or refused --
is already written to disk by the tools that made it, so nothing about it needs
summarising: it is listed.

The ledger is appended once after each compaction, as a note under the summary
(the ``append_note`` grant), and says where each thing lives so the model asks
the tool for the file rather than rebuilding from memory.
