"""Factories the manifest names: eleven deck tools and the turn-frame hook.

The registry calls one factory per contribution, each with its own
``PluginContext``, so the tools and the hook cannot be handed to each other
directly. A per-workspace :class:`_Shared` bridges them (the research-flow
shape): whichever factory runs first builds it, and every side reads the same
config slice, the same prototypes and the same per-workdir engine cache.

Admission is the D6 shape the other product plugins use: an absent or false
``enabled`` in ``plugins.config["ppt-engine"]`` means no surface is cast at
all, and a build whose deck dependencies cannot import declines the tools the
way the fork's assembly returned ``[]`` (verdict feature 1's factory-decline
convention). The fork's own gate was ``tools.ppt.enabled``, read per assembly;
plugin admission runs at the same time in this host, so the flip is of key
path, not of moment (D4/D5). A slice that does not PARSE is neither on nor
off: the host's stack builder skips a raising factory quietly, so the parse
error is caught here, the tool factories decline, and ``make_hook`` casts the
fail-closed :class:`~raven_ppt.plugin.hook.MisconfiguredEngineHook` -- every
turn answers with the config fix named until someone repairs the slice (the
code-flow MisconfiguredGate doctrine, w101).

Ten of the eleven tools are the fork's, re-seated per turn by
:mod:`.session_tools`; the eleventh, ``ppt_image_search``, is the D2
adaptation of the image search the fork had grown inside the trunk built-in
``web_search``.
