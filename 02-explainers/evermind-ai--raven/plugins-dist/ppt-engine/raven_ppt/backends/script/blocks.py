"""Which part of the program drew which page.

Review works on one page at a time, so a render has to be matched to that page's
code and nothing else. Two sources, and the order matters.

Execution is exact: every `add_slide` call has the script line that made it on
the stack, so the runner records it and the spans follow by construction. There
is no annotation to go stale and no way to pair a render with the wrong code.

The `# SLIDE <n>` comments are the fallback, and they earn their place in one
situation the record cannot cover: after a build that failed, the record still
describes the script that last built, while the comments survived the edit that
broke it. So a traceback is attributed through the comments.
