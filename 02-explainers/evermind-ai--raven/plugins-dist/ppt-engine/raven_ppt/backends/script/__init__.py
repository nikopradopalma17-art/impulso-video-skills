"""The route where the author writes the deck as a python-pptx program.

The alternative was a schema of semantic regions the engine compiled. It bounded
the deck at what the schema could say and filled the rest in itself -- a band
across every title, a panel behind a narrow one, a tile under every icon -- so
seventeen different compositions still read as one template. A script has no such
ceiling: the author defines its own page furniture once and uses it throughout,
which is what a designed deck is.

The cost is that the program is now the thing under management, and three
problems follow from that. Which part of it drew which page (blocks). Whether a
submission is a program at all (submission). And whether a build that died can be
attributed to a page (blocks.broken_page). Each has a module.
