"""The three-shield gate as a composable pipeline (SOP §2 ⑥).

Order matters and each shield narrows the task set the next one judges:

1. **Gate-f (measurement validity).** Report tasks whose eval was contaminated by
   an infrastructure failure on *either* arm, but do NOT drop them from the
   denominator (SOP §0 hard rule: detect -> rerun <=2 -> still-fail counts as 0,
   kept in the denominator; dropping shrinks the denominator and overestimates
   pass@1). Recoverable infra is salvaged upstream by the rerun ladder
   (:func:`evolver.orchestrator.scoring.eval_with_infra_rerun`); by the
   time run_gates sees the evals, a still-infra trial is scored as a non-pass via
   ``pass_rate``. Infra is read from ``infra_attempts`` when present (AppWorld
   surfaces it; benches without it report nothing here).
2. **Gate-b (attribution).** Only credit the candidate on tasks where its
   mechanism actually fired — a patch can't get credit for a task it never
   touched. The set of fired tasks comes from an injectable source (the
   activation ledger / beacon); when none is given this shield is a no-op.
3. **Gate2 (significance).** Paired lift on the surviving tasks: navigator
   promotion (mean > vanilla) plus a separate credited-2σ label.

Keeping this a pure function over eval maps makes it bench-agnostic and unit
testable; the loop calls it once per candidate after the confirm eval.
