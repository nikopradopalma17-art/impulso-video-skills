"""Pluggable decision policy — the seam the two benchmark lines diverge on.

The seven-step funnel's outer loop is identical across benchmarks; only the
per-candidate *decision* (screen -> confirm -> promote) and the *control arm* it
compares against differ. Those two concerns are captured here as two protocols
so ``loop._run_round`` stays a thin driver:

- :class:`GatePolicy` — given a :class:`DecisionContext`, run whatever
  screen/confirm/significance logic the bench uses and return one
  :class:`CandidateOutcome`. The policy owns its own ``eval`` calls because the
  two lines eval different task sets at different stages (K=1 anchor vs K=3
  focused subset). The loop never scores for itself anymore.
- :class:`BaselineProvider` — supply the control arm (a :class:`Baseline`) for
  the round and absorb the ratchet on promotion. Frozen cold-start, per-parent
  frozen, and same-session paired are the three implementations; the gate never
  knows which produced its control, which is why the two seams are orthogonal.

The empirical regime-shift finding (a frozen baseline compared across time is
unreliable when a whole run can shift ~12pp) is why
:class:`SameSessionPairedBaseline` exists and is the methodology-correct choice;
the frozen variants are kept as cost-bound fallbacks and labelled as such.
