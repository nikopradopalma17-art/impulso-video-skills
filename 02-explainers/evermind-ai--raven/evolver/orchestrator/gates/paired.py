"""Gate2 — paired lift + 2σ significance (a generalisation of round7_paired).

The scratchpad ``round7_paired.py`` hard-coded its anchor/explore task lists and
its two arms. This is the same statistics with the task set and the two arms
passed in, so it works for any round and any domain.

Pairing is what makes the test sensitive: comparing candidate and vanilla on the
*same* tasks removes between-task difficulty, so the standard error is the
spread of the per-task differences, not the spread of raw pass rates. For each
task we take the per-task pass-rate difference ``d_i = rate_candidate,i -
rate_vanilla,i`` (K=3 rates), and test whether the mean difference is far enough
from zero:

    mean_lift = mean(d_i)
    se        = stdev(d_i) / sqrt(n)          # paired standard error
    z         = mean_lift / se

Promotion to bank (SOP §2 ⑥ Gate2) is the *navigator* condition alone: the
candidate's mean pass@1 beats vanilla on the shared train set. The paired 2σ
test is a separate *credited-significance* label (``credited_2sigma``) reported
alongside — it says whether the lift is statistically significant, not whether
the candidate banks. This matches the manual round-3 decision, where
budgetnudge banked on +6.4pp over vanilla even though its paired z (1.71) fell
short of 2σ. A candidate that improves every shared task identically has
``se == 0``; that deterministic win is reported as ``z = inf``.

Whether a banked candidate becomes the next parent, or is pruned for a
qualitative reason (e.g. anchor/full-set sign-flip signalling interference), is
a semantic step ⑦ decision layered on top of this gate, not part of it.
