"""The two concrete gate policies (SWE paired-2sigma, AppWorld focused-Fisher).

Both implement :class:`GatePolicy.decide` over a :class:`DecisionContext`,
owning their own ``eval`` calls. Neither knows how its control arm was produced
(frozen vs same-session) — that is the :class:`BaselineProvider`'s concern.

Both stages follow the SOP's two disciplines:

- **Wide-pass screen (SOP §2 ⑤a).** A candidate advances to the full-train
  confirm unless it is *clearly worse* than the baseline on its probe set. A
  slightly-low or noise-band probe is NOT evidence — small K=1/K=3 probes have
  huge variance and the probe mean does not predict the full-set mean.
- **Two-threshold verdict (SOP §0).** Promotion (banking, parent selection) is
  the loose *navigator* condition: candidate full-train mean beats the control.
  The paired-2σ significance is a separate *credited* label reported alongside
  (``CandidateOutcome.paired.credited_2sigma``), never the promotion bar.

The confirm job name is defined once here (:func:`confirm_job_name`) because it
doubles as the on-disk out-dir a bench's diagnosis later reads trajectories
from — the naming is a cross-module contract, not a local detail.
