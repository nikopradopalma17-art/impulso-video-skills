"""Sealed test scoring — the train/test firewall as a mechanism, not a rule.

The SOP's iron law is that the sealed test set never influences an evolution
decision: the loop compares candidates against vanilla on *train* only, and test
is scored blind, its numbers unread until the run ends (retention = test_lift /
train_lift, computed at unseal). Historically this was enforced by discipline.
Here it's enforced by construction:

- :func:`assert_no_test_leak` fails loudly if any test id has crept into the
  anchor or train task sets (an anchor/train that contains test = leakage).
- :class:`SealedTestRunner.score` writes per-task test results to a sealed dir
  the driver never reads and **returns nothing** — there is no path for a test
  number to reach a gate or a verdict. Only :meth:`unseal`, called after the
  loop finishes, reads them back.
