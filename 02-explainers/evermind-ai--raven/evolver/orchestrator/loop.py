"""The seven-step funnel as a finite-state machine.

This is the layer the SOP used to delegate to a long, high-compliance Claude
session. Here the control flow is code: the round loop, the per-candidate fork,
parent selection, and the stop decision. Everything bench-specific is bundled in
an injected :class:`~evolver.orchestrator.scoring.EvalBackend`; the
per-candidate decision (screen -> confirm -> promote) and the control arm are
injected as a :class:`GatePolicy` and a :class:`BaselineProvider`. So a weaker
driver model (Qwen / Kimi) can run the loop without remembering the funnel's
shape, and SWE-bench / AppWorld / a no-benchmark LLM judge all share one loop —
they differ only in which backend + policy + baseline get wired in.

Two per-round signals feed termination, and they are NOT the same thing:

- ``promoted`` — the parent changed: some candidate passed the gate against its
  round baseline AND beat the incumbent parent's train score (the Alg.1 L135
  argmax). A gate-passer that loses the argmax banks but does not take over.
- ``beat_vanilla`` — a candidate's full-train confirm beat the FIXED vanilla
  cold-start mean. This is the SOP's patience signal (no candidate's train mean
  beats vanilla for N consecutive rounds), measured against vanilla for every
  benchmark regardless of which
  baseline provider gates promotion. A round that erred out entirely sets
  ``errored`` instead and burns neither counter (it has its own stop).

The semantic steps are still injected callables:

- ``diagnose_fn`` (①): read the last child's trajectories, return a failure map.
- ``design_fn``   (②): pick WHYs and design candidates (:class:`AppliedPatch`).
- ``preflight_fn`` (③, optional): drop inert candidates; default keeps all.
- ``apply_fn``    (④): apply a patch on the parent, persist a child node.
- ``verdict_fn``  (⑦, optional): draft a per-round verdict for the findings log.

⑤/⑥ (screen/confirm/gate) are the ``gate_policy``'s job; the control arm each
round comes from the ``baseline_provider`` (frozen cold-start by default, or the
methodology-correct same-session provider). ``focused_source`` supplies a
candidate's WHY subset (AppWorld's Fisher gate); ``outcome_hook`` lets a bench
learn across rounds (AppWorld's attempt history), and ``inert_hook`` feeds it
the preflight-pruned candidates that never reach a DecisionContext. All
default off.

On-disk state under ``config.work_dir`` (all best-effort, all resume-safe):
``failure_map.json`` (the cross-round live map), ``nodes/<node_id>.json`` (the
node ledger: identity + git anchor + final status + gate stats, one file per
candidate), and ``findings.md`` (a human-readable per-round log with the
driver's verdict). The round journal the caller passes to :meth:`run` is the
loop-progress record those three complement.
