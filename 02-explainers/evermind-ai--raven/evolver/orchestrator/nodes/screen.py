"""Step ⑤a — the K=1 anchor screen with a wide-pass verdict.

The screen is deliberately wide (wide-pass): a candidate advances to the full-set
confirm unless its anchor-mean pass@1 falls *clearly* below vanilla's. The SOP
describes three buckets, but operationally there is a single cut:

- clear win        (margin >= +cull_threshold)  -> confirm
- within the band  (|margin| <  cull_threshold)  -> confirm  (a slightly-low
                                                    anchor mean is not the
                                                    full-set mean; don't cull)
- clear loss       (margin <= -cull_threshold)  -> pruned_at_screen

``cull_threshold`` is ``cull_sigma_mult * sigma_screen`` from ``select_anchor``,
i.e. sized off the *same* vanilla thick ledger the anchor was drawn from, so the
band reflects genuine K=1 anchor-mean sampling noise rather than a guess.

Vanilla's anchor mean is read from the cold-start thick-ledger per-task rates
(K=3, the fixed baseline the funnel always compares against); the candidate's is
the K=1 screen run. Comparing a noisy K=1 mean against a tighter K=3 mean is
exactly why the band is wide.
