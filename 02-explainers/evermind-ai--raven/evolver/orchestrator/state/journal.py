"""Round journal — append-only checkpoint so a killed run resumes.

Each completed round appends one JSON line with just enough to reconstruct the
loop's control state on restart: the round index, the parent it evolved to, and
whether it promoted (which drives the termination counter). On resume the loop
replays these records to seed the :class:`TerminationTracker`, the current
parent, and the round counter, then continues from the next round without
re-running the expensive evals it already did.

The node ledger (``nodes/*.json``) is the durable record of the *nodes*; this
journal is the durable record of the *loop's progress* over them.
