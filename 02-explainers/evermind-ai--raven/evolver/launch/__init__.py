"""Unified launch layer: one config file + one command for any registered bench.

``python -m evolver run --config <yaml>`` drives the whole SOP flow as a
resumable state machine: cold-start thick ledger -> evolution rounds ->
terminate -> unseal. Interrupt anywhere; re-running the same command resumes
from the last durable artifact (trial files / round journal / meta stamps).
