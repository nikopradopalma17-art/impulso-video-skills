"""LLM-judge subsystem for the evolver.

Reads compressed trajectories, classifies failures as L1/L2/L3
(spec §3), and proposes structured (WHERE, WHY) patches for L2/L3 cases
(spec §12.4-§12.5).

Public surface:

- ``IssueType`` / ``PatchWhere`` / ``PatchWhy`` / ``ActionKind`` — enums
- ``JudgeAction`` / ``JudgeResult`` — parsed analysis dataclasses
- ``build_judge_messages`` — assemble (system, user) for one LLM call
- ``parse_judge_output`` — turn LLM raw text into a validated JudgeResult
- ``JudgeParseError`` — raised on malformed output

The LLM client itself is in ``evolver.judge.llm_client`` (B3,
written separately).
