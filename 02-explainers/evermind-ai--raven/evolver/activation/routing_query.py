"""dry_query -- offline probe of the real skill discovery + selection path.

It answers, without an LLM or the SR server, "which skill names would routing
inject for this task?" -- by building a real :class:`LocalSkillCatalog` and
:class:`SkillForgeRouter` whose ``local_dirs`` point at ``library_root``, and
running the actual BM25 retrieval and resolve path.

A skill authored on disk is injected only if its directory is mounted as a
discovery layer: a ``SkillForgeConfig`` that is disabled, or carries no
``local_dirs``, makes ``select()`` return an empty list before any retrieval
runs. That is what this probe exists to show, benchmark harness by benchmark
harness.

No LLM is involved: the LLM gate and the query rewriter are off, so selection
reduces to filesystem discovery plus lexical (BM25) scoring -- the
deterministic core of the real path.

        surfaces (ContextBuilder.build_system_prompt): the ``always: true``
