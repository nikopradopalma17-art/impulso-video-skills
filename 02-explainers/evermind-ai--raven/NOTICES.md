# Third-Party Notices

Raven is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. It incorporates code from the
projects below (MIT unless noted). Their copyright notices and license texts are
retained in `LICENSES/`.

## nanobot (base agent runtime)
- Source: https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot
- Copyright (c) 2025 nanobot contributors
- License: MIT — see `LICENSES/MIT-nanobot.txt`
- Scope: forked at v0.1.5.post3; modified throughout `raven/`
  (agent/, bus/, channels/, cli/, config/, cron/, providers/, session/,
   skills/, templates/, utils/).

## hermes-agent (TUI layer)
- Source: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent
- Copyright (c) 2025 Nous Research
- License: MIT — see `LICENSES/MIT-hermes-agent.txt`
- Vendored at commit: `dd0923bb89ed2dd56f82cb63656a1323f6f42e6f` (2026-05-12)
- Scope: full `ui-tui/` import (169 files / ~31.6k LOC TypeScript src
  + ~26.3k LOC vendored `@hermes/ink`). Modifications: branding replaced
  with minimal Raven component, gateway stubbed (no real IPC; deferred
  to `tui-ipc-bridge` L2), 36+ env vars renamed `HERMES_*` → `RAVEN_*`,
  literal Hermes/Nous brand strings replaced throughout `ui-tui/src/`,
  SPDX/Copyright headers added to every ≥ 50 LOC source file.

## ink (vendored via `@hermes/ink`)
- Upstream source: https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink
- Copyright (c) Vadym Demedes, Sindre Sorhus, and ink contributors
- License: MIT — see `LICENSES/MIT-ink.txt`
- Scope: hermes-agent ships its own fork of community ink at
  `ui-tui/packages/hermes-ink/` (~26.3k LOC). Raven inherits this
  vendor verbatim (package name `@hermes/ink` preserved for attribution).
  Triple attribution chain (ink contributors → Nous Research hermes-ink
  → EverMind modifications) is encoded in the 5-line SPDX header of
  every substantial file under `ui-tui/packages/hermes-ink/src/`.
  The fork policy (hard fork, no upstream sync, fixes land in-tree) lives
  in `ui-tui/packages/hermes-ink/README.md`.

## agentscope (web-service framework)
- Upstream source: https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope
- Copyright (c) 2025 Alibaba Group and AgentScope contributors
- License: Apache-2.0 - see `LICENSES/Apache-2.0-agentscope.txt`
- Adopted at commit: `c84fd1a54dcc207257a8d616ff63b65470febc95` (the RavenX fork
  of agentscope 2.0.4, itself based on upstream `4cb58320`)
- Scope: the vendored tree it was adopted into (`ui-webui/service/agentscope/`,
  284 files supplying the retired web service's FastAPI app, Redis storage,
  RAG/knowledge-base managers and sub-agent DAG machinery) was removed with
  `ui-webui` itself. What remains in this repository, and what this notice is
  now about, is the code adopted FROM it and rewritten in place:
  `raven/knowledge/_types.py`, `raven/knowledge/_chunker.py`,
  and `raven/knowledge/_parser.py`. Each names its origin in its own module
  docstring. A fourth module, `dag_projection`, carried derived code until it
  was removed for having no importer; nothing of it remains.
- Modifications: the three modules above are rewritten rather than vendored --
  they take agentscope's chunking, parsing and DAG-projection logic and nothing
  else, and they carry no agentscope import. The attribution stays because the
  derivation does; the licence text is kept at
  `LICENSES/Apache-2.0-agentscope.txt`. The retired tree's own PROVENANCE.md
  went with it, and its per-subsystem trimming rationale is only of interest to
  a tree that no longer exists.

# External Runtime Tools (not vendored)

The following tools are invoked by Raven via `subprocess` calls but are
**not bundled or redistributed** as part of any Raven release artifact.
Their attribution here is supply-chain hygiene, not a license requirement.
Users install them separately through their respective package managers.

## tui-use (TUI autotest harness Tier 1 backend)
- Source: https://github.com/onesuper/tui-use
- Copyright (c) 2026 Wei Hong (onesuper)
- License: MIT
- Install: `npm install -g tui-use` (npm package `tui-use`)
- Scope: invoked by `tests/tui/autotest/runner.py::Harness` for PTY-driven
  TUI subprocess control. Selected as Tier 1 backend per Day 0 spike
  (2026-05-20) — all 5 acceptance gates S1-S5 passed. Raven does NOT
  vendor, redistribute, or modify `tui-use` source.
- Fallback contingency: if upstream maintenance halts (>90 days no push) or
  a severe incompatibility surfaces, the vendor-or-pivot decision follows the
  L0-L3 ladder recorded with the original evaluation.
  Vendoring (path L1) Vendoring (path L1) would require moving
  `tui-use` to `vendor/tui-use/` and adding its LICENSE to `LICENSES/` plus
  updating this section's "Scope" line to "vendored" — same pattern as
  `hermes-agent` above.
