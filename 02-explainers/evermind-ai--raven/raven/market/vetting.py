"""What PlugHub is allowed to fetch, and what a catalogue entry may ask for.

Two trust boundaries meet in PlugHub, and neither is the user:

* the **hub endpoint** (``RAVEN_PLUGHUB_URL`` / ``RAVEN_SKILLHUB_URL``): whoever
  answers it dictates the catalogue, so a plaintext or non-HTTP endpoint hands
  the catalogue to anyone on the path. That is a supply-chain hole rather than a
  transient outage, so it is refused instead of degraded. The URL rules that
  refuse it are :mod:`raven.security.urls`, shared with the Skill Hub client;
  what is left here is the half only PlugHub has.
* the **catalogue entry**: a stdio entry is a command line raven will execute.
  The entry cannot be trusted to name any command it likes, so this module
  narrows what a hub can pick to package runners whose payload is a visible
  package name, and refuses environment variables whose only purpose is to load
  code into the child.

Nothing here constrains a hand-written ``config.json`` -- a user editing their
own file is the trusted party. The checks apply to what arrives over the wire.

# Package runners: the payload they execute is a package name sitting in `args`,
# which the install confirm shows the user verbatim. A shell, an interpreter, or
# an absolute path to a downloaded binary is not something a remote catalogue
# gets to choose -- widening this set is a deliberate act, not a config knob.
#
# `pipx` is deliberately absent even though it is a package runner. Its payload is
# the *second* positional (`pipx run <app>`), so the rule below -- the first
# non-flag token is the package -- validates the literal word "run" and lets every
# later flag through, including `--python-args "-c ..."`, which runs the
# attacker's code under a package name the confirm dialog still shows as
# trustworthy. Supporting it needs a subcommand-aware parser, and shipping the
# wrong parser here is remote code execution, so it stays out until someone
# writes that on purpose.
