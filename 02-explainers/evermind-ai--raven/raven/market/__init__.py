"""PlugHub — the plugin marketplace engine.

A PlugHub plugin is a catalog entry, not a program: it declares
0..n contributions, each landing at a different injection point (an
``mcp`` config stanza, a workspace skill, a python package). Installing is
a ledger-backed transaction over those pieces; uninstalling replays the
ledger in reverse.

Modules:

- :mod:`raven.market.catalog` — entry source (bundled JSON, hub override)
- :mod:`raven.market.ledger`  — one JSON file per installed plugin
- :mod:`raven.market.install` — atomic install / uninstall / toggle
- :mod:`raven.market.vetting`   — what a catalogue entry may ask for (the URL
  rules it leans on are :mod:`raven.security.urls`)
- :mod:`raven.market.connect` — install + connect + rollback, shared by every surface
