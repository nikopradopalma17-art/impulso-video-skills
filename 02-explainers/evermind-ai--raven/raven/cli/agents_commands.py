"""Agents scaffolding subcommands -- owns the ``agents_app`` Typer instance.

``raven agents new <name>`` instantiates the packaged scaffold templates
(``raven/templates/agents_scaffold/``) into a fresh agent folder: the roster
manifest, the launcher, the birth-certificate config, and a plugin package
carrying one tool and one hook factory. A folder dropped under the raven
home's ``agents/`` tree is discovered without registration, which is why
``--register`` defaults to off.

One name derives every identity the templates spell four ways: the kebab
machine id (``my-agent``), the Title-Case display name (``My-Agent``), the
python package (``my_agent``), and the env-var prefix (``MY_AGENT``, the
``api_key_var`` convention). Instantiation is a string replacement of those
four spellings over every template file and path.

After the write the command walks the rest of the closed loop itself:
doctor (the generated manifest re-validated, the plugin manifest re-parsed,
every .py compiled, discovery really scanned), then smoke (spawn the
discovered row's command and exchange one ACP ``initialize`` frame -- the S1
gate-B recipe), then the next-steps card. A launcher that refuses loudly for
want of a key is reported as the fail-closed design working, not as a broken
chain.

``commands.py`` wires this in through :func:`register`, the same door the
top-level commands use.
