"""Seven-step onboarding wizard: provider → sandbox → channel → memory → web → sub-agents → import.

Goal: get a new user from ``pip install`` to a working agent in a few
minutes, without ever opening ``~/.raven/config.json`` or
``~/.everos/raven/everos.toml``.

Steps:
  0. Welcome
  1. LLM provider (required; multi-provider, in-step connectivity + test probe)
  2. Sandbox / run location (optional, single-select)
  3. Chat channel (optional, stackable)
  4. EverOS long-term memory (optional; llm/embedding required once enabled,
     rerank/multimodal optional)
  5. Web access (optional; pick a search vendor and a page reader and give
     each its key; keys are mirrored to ~/.raven/env so sub-agents inherit them)
  6. Sub-agents shipped in this checkout (optional; per folder, own key or
     this raven's LLM)
  7. Cold-start import from other AI tools (optional)
  8. Done

All writes go through the ``update_providers`` / ``update_channels`` /
``update`` ops libraries and the memory plugin's own config module — this
module owns the UX layer, not config-schema knowledge.

Navigation: questionary 2.1.1 has no first-class cross-screen "back", so the
wizard is a screen state machine and back is expressed as a ``0) back``
sentinel choice on the screens that support it (Step 1 <-> language pick,
Step 2 -> Step 1); Steps 3 to 7 are optional and forward-only (re-run
``onboard`` to change them). Ctrl+C exits at any point, keeping whatever was
already written.
