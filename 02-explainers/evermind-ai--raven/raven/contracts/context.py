"""ContextEngine ABC — contract for the context engine.

This package (``raven.context_engine``) hosts the single
:class:`ContextAssembler` (a concrete subclass of
:class:`ContextEngine`) plus its building blocks. AgentLoop holds
exactly one ``self.context_engine: ContextEngine`` reference, built via
:func:`raven.context_engine.build_context_engine`. The ABC lets an
alternative engine be slotted in; one implementation ships.

Naming note:
    Named ``context_engine`` (not ``context``) to mirror the L4
    ``memory_engine`` package and to avoid colliding with
    :mod:`raven.agent.context`, which hosts the lower-level
    :class:`ContextBuilder` utility that engines use as a building block.

Layering note:
    The data carriers ``AssembledContext`` and ``TokenBudget`` live in
    :mod:`raven.contracts.assembled`; they are shared value objects,
    not part of this contract's surface.

    ``stable`` says this segment's text does not depend on what the user just
    said, so it reads the same on the next turn as on this one.

    Per conversation, not per process. The identity segment interpolates the
    turn's bound workdir and the resolved model id, so two chats in one gateway
    process hold two different heads and two cache entries -- which is correct,
    they are different prompts. Read as "stable process-wide" this flag looks
    wrong; it is not, and nothing a segment could declare would collapse two
    genuinely different prompts into one cached prefix. The assembler
    uses it to tell the provider how much of the system message may carry a
    prompt-cache breakpoint of its own; only the unbroken run of stable builders
    at the *start* counts, because a cache key covers everything in front of it,
    so one volatile segment ends the run for every stable segment behind it.
    The default ``False`` is the safe answer: a segment wrongly called stable
    would have its neighbours cached under a key that changes anyway, which
