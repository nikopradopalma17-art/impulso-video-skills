"""MemoryBackend Protocol — the single contract every memory plugin implements.

The seam between AgentLoop and the memory subsystem, and the only memory
contract.

Three design points to flag for plugin authors:

- ``recall`` names the track explicitly: it takes ``user_id`` XOR
  ``agent_id`` (exactly one set). Dual-track backends (EverOS) route
  the set field to the matching store (user episodes/profiles vs agent
  cases/skills); flat backends (mem0, MemOS) use ``user_id`` and return
  ``[]`` for the ``agent_id`` call. Ids are bare, backend-native
  strings — no ``"user:"`` / ``"agent:"`` prefix convention.

- ``Memory.metadata`` is the **escape hatch**. ``text`` and ``score``
  are normalized; everything backend-specific (categories, episode
  type, native id, source labels) goes in ``metadata``. The host's
  context assembler does **not** read ``metadata`` — only the
  pre-rendered ``text`` lands in the prompt. Skill-source adapters
  that re-emit Memory hits as ScoredSkill do read ``metadata`` for
  qualified-id construction.

- ``feedback`` is **allowed to be a no-op**. Most backends have no
  native concept of "skill confidence" or "execution signal"; the
  Protocol exposes the slot so EverOS-style backends can consume it
  without forcing every adapter to fake support.

The Protocol is :func:`typing.runtime_checkable` so ``isinstance(x,
MemoryBackend)`` works in tests — at the cost of accepting any class
whose surface matches, including duck-typed mocks. That's the trade we
want: contract tests don't have to inherit from a base class.

Failure contract. A session host -- the agent loop, the TUI, the gateway,
``raven serve`` -- wraps every call into a backend and treats a raise as the
loss of that one call: ``recall`` counts as no hits, ``store`` as not landed,
``start`` as no long-term memory for this session, ``feedback`` and ``stop``
as logged and ignored. The import CLI (``raven import``) is the deliberate
exception: nothing wraps ``start`` or ``stop`` there, so a raise in either ends
the command, and a ``store`` that raises or returns ``False`` fails that one
source and leaves it unsubmitted for a retry rather than passing as not landed:
``run_import`` catches per source, and a ``False`` becomes the
``MemoryWriteDroppedError`` that ``_feed_session`` raises into that same
``except``. A bulk import that runs against nothing would consume the source
list while writing nothing.

A backend that can classify its own failures (a timeout is not a refused
connection) should catch and act on them, because the host cannot; what it
does not understand it may let propagate.

        ``messages`` follows the AgentLoop ``{"role", "content", ...}``
        shape — the existing list-of-dicts form the codebase already
        produces, so adapters don't need a conversion step. Backends
        that want to chunk / deduplicate / extract are free to.

        ``metadata`` is an optional dict for caller-supplied context
        that does not fit the message list.  Callers may pass
        backend-specific fields such as ``app_id``, ``project_id``,
        or ``is_final``; normal AgentLoop turns leave it ``None``.
        Backends that do not consume metadata ignore it silently.

        Two keys are conventions every backend should honour if it can:

        ``flush``
            ``True`` means extract from this slice now rather than when the
            backend's own cadence next comes round. The host sets it when it
            is handing over a conversation that has already finished, and
            will read the result back immediately -- waiting for a turn
            counter that will never advance again would return nothing.

        ``user_id`` / ``agent_id``
            Whose memory this slice is, **for this call only**. The host sets
            them when writing on behalf of a sub-agent that ran in a process
            of its own: the content is that agent's, not the host's, and
            filing it under the host would put it where recall for that agent
            never looks. This does not make a second source for the backend's
            own identity, which stays the one the host granted at build time;
            it is an explicit per-call override and nothing reads it as a
            default.

        Does not raise on transport / auth errors; it reports them.
        Both known callers act on the return value: the AgentLoop
        retries a turn's write with backoff and gives up after a fixed
        number of attempts, still counting the turn as unindexed if
        every attempt fails; a bulk import marks a source done in its
        resume state, so a write silently treated as landed would erase
        the only record that the source is still pending.

        Only an explicit ``False`` means the write failed. A backend
        that returns ``None`` (or anything else falsy-but-not-``False``)
        has not claimed the write was lost, so callers treat it as
        landed.

        the host asks after a sub-agent has run in a process of its own. That
        is a different question from :meth:`recall`'s, and folding it in there
        would mean a query nobody wrote and a score nothing computed.

        Same XOR rule as :meth:`recall`: exactly one of ``user_id`` /
        ``agent_id``. ``[]`` is a valid answer -- an empty session, and equally
        a backend that cannot filter by session at all. A host feature built on
