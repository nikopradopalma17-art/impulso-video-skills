"""AgentHook ABC + AgentHookContext + HookDecision.

Factory-loop tier: Versioned with the factory loop, not frozen for every
loop — a replacement loop may ship its own hook vocabulary and version this
paper with it. Only the ``contract`` tier is a cross-loop promise.

The hook chain is the loop's one extension door: the host hands finished
hooks and the loop fires six phases -- one on the way in, three per ReAct
iteration, one when a turn ends with nothing to show, one on the way out.
eval_engine builds three concrete hooks on the iteration phases; a product
that needs to steer the loop (budget notes, forced finalization, spin
breaking) builds its own on the same six.

Design choices:

1. **All phases default to no-op.** Every method on ``AgentHook``
   returns a pass-through ``HookDecision()`` unless overridden. Subclasses
   only implement the phases they care about.

2. **Async everywhere.** Even phases that look synchronous today (e.g.
   ``response_modifier`` takes ``(str, str) -> str``) become ``async``
   here so an LLM-based hook (Eval judge, personalizer classifier) can
   be added without redoing the interface. Sync callers can simply
   ``return`` immediately.

3. **Four orthogonal return modes**, all expressed via
   ``HookDecision``:

   - *pass-through* — default. Let the next hook / main loop continue.
   - *short_circuit_result* — halt the chain and the AgentLoop returns
     this value as the outbound reply (or processes it as a final
     answer, depending on the phase). Used by the Sentinel decision
     consumer and the personalizer "ask a clarification question" branch.
   - *modified_content* — for ``after_send``: transform the outbound
     text. Used by Sentinel's nudge_inject (append nudge to reply).
   - *rollback* — for the iteration phases: discard what this iteration
     appended and re-sample the LLM call without consuming an iteration,
     optionally with injected messages the re-sample sees and generation
     overrides for that one call. How a gate bounces a draft back.

   ``modified_tools`` (``before_iteration``) is not a mode but a grant: the
   tool schemas the model is shown for this one iteration. ``append_note``
   (the three iteration phases) is the other grant: a short harness-authored
   note the loop appends to the last transcript message before the next
   model call -- a budget warning, a gate notice -- chained across hooks in
   order. The note is data the model reads, never a message the user sent;
   the transcript keeps it where it landed. On ``before_user_inbound``,
   ``modified_content`` rewrites the inbound text before the loop dispatches
   it (a memo prepended, a reminder appended), chained through
   ``ctx.inbound_content``.

4. **HookDecision is immutable from the hook's perspective.** Hooks
   build a fresh decision each call; ``CompositeHook`` is responsible
   for chaining modifications (next hook sees the previous hook's
   transformed content via ``ctx.outbound_content``).

5. **AgentHookContext fields are populated by phase.** Not every
   attribute is meaningful in every phase — e.g. ``turn_request`` is
   set during ``before_user_inbound`` but ``None`` during
   ``before_iteration``. Callers (AgentLoop) are responsible
   for setting the relevant fields before invoking a phase. Hooks
   should not panic on ``None`` for unused fields.

class HookDecision:
    """Result of a hook invocation.

    Four states (mutually compatible only in this combinatorial sense):

    - ``pass_through=True``, no short-circuit, no modification — default,
      continue to next hook / main loop.
    - ``short_circuit_result`` is set — halt the chain; AgentLoop treats
      this value as the final answer for the current phase.
    - ``modified_content`` is set — only meaningful for the ``after_send``
      phase; the next hook in the chain sees the modified text as
      ``ctx.outbound_content``.
    - ``rollback=True`` — halt the chain; AgentLoop pops every message the
      current iteration appended and re-samples the LLM call without
      consuming an iteration. Honored in ``before_execute_tools`` (the
      proposed tool calls are discarded unexecuted) and ``after_iteration``
      (tool side effects, if any ran, stand -- only the history is popped).
      Bounded per turn by the loop's rollback cap; past the cap the decision
      degrades to pass-through and the refusal is counted in
      ``ctx.metadata["rollbacks_refused"]``. Every honoured rollback is
      counted in ``ctx.metadata["hook_rollbacks"]``, so a later hook can tell
      a re-sampled iteration from the first sampling of that number (the
      counter is what makes "this is the turn boundary" decidable after a
      rollback to iteration 1). ``rollback_overrides`` carries
      generation-parameter overrides for the re-sample call only (keys
      outside the loop's allowlist are dropped); ``rollback_inject`` carries
      messages appended after the pop, so the re-sample sees them -- they
      persist into history like any prompt the model was shown.

    ``modified_tools`` is a grant, not a halting state: in
    ``before_iteration`` it replaces the tool schemas the model is shown
    for this one iteration. The registry is untouched, so the next
    iteration starts from the full set unless a hook decides again.

    ``append_note`` is the second grant: text the loop appends to the last
    transcript message (a blank line between) before the next model call, in
    the three iteration phases. Chained: every hook's note lands, in order.

    ``notes`` is the diagnostic trail: free-form strings a hook leaves about
    what it saw and decided. The loop deliberately does not act on them;
    ``CompositeHook`` chains them in hook order onto the decision it returns
    -- a halting decision carries the notes collected before it, then its
    own -- so a caller or harness reads one ordered list.

    Hooks should not mix the halting states in a single decision -- the
    first halting state wins and the rest would be moot.
