"""The plugin contribution surface: the grants a plugin is handed.

A plugin is built OUTSIDE this repository against these three shapes -- the
everos-memory distribution already is -- which makes them papers rather than
plugin machinery: a factory receives a :class:`ServiceLocator`
(construction-time grants), a contributed tool that declares
``bind_runtime(handles)`` receives :class:`RuntimeHandles` (the assembled
loop's late-bound grants), and a binder declines with
:class:`BindDeclinedError`. The envelope that carries them
(``PluginContext``) and the discovery/registry machinery stay in
``raven/plugins``: the papers hold what a third party implements against,
never the machinery that serves it.

A contributed tool may also declare ``configured() -> bool``, an authored
member ``admit_tool`` checks and dispenses on the frozen ``ToolSpec``: the
loop asks it per tool-array assembly and withholds a False for that turn, the
reversible lane the built-in media tools are withheld on. Undeclared: always offered.

Address note: ``raven/plugins/context.py`` re-exports all three, and that
spelling stays the documented import for plugin authors -- moving the
definitions under the papers changes who guards them, not who serves them.
