"""The four harness strategy roles the agent loop delegates to.

Factory-loop tier: Versioned with the factory loop, not frozen for every
loop — a replacement loop may ship its own strategy vocabulary and version
this paper with it. Only the ``contract`` tier is a cross-loop promise.

The four roles name the strategy *decisions* a turn makes, not four layers and
not the loop itself. Memory assembles the window the model sees and decides how
a transcript is made to fit again mid-turn, Planning may prepare turn guidance,
Capability picks the tool definitions one iteration exposes, and Action produces
one usable model response and judges a call against the dispatch's Charter.
Each also answers for the participants seated on it: Memory their intake, Planning
their advice, Action their review and salvage.

``Sequence[AgentParticipant]`` on those four, and not one participant, because a seat
speaks for more than a plugin: a dispatch's own judgements and anything
generated for it join the same list once they are materialised. Today a seat
holds the one participant its plugin wrote, so a process running two plugins asks
the role twice, once per seat -- composing *across* plugins stays where it has
always been, in the hook composite, and the role composes the participants of
the seat that asked. Everything else the turn does --
iteration accounting, hook phases, tool execution and approval, persistence and
event order -- stays with the L2 shell, which is what makes these four
replaceable at all.

The in-loop recoveries are split along that line rather than sitting on one
side of it. Memory answers *what to give up* (see ``shrink``); the shell owns
the *mechanism* -- noticing the refusal, re-entering the iteration, and
bounding how many times a turn may pay for it. A replacement that answers
``shrink`` with an unchanged transcript therefore does not merely decline a
policy: the shell's ``changed`` test never fires, and an overflow the loop
could have recovered from ends the turn.

_Avoid_: reading ``ActionModule`` as "the loop". The shell owns retries, tool
execution and events; Action owns one model decision and the Charter's verdict
on a call. And reading Memory as the memory engine: Memory here is the turn's
*window*, which the context engine owns; long-term recall is a different organ
behind its own paper.
