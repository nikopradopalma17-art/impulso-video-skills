"""AgentParticipant: the narrow verbs a sub-agent implements instead of the six hook phases.

Factory-loop tier: Versioned with the factory loop, not frozen for every
loop. The hook phases (``loop_hooks``) are the *timing* contract -- when the
loop asks, in what order, what a refusal does. This paper is the *judgement*
contract: given one step of the turn, what does this agent say about it. The
two are kept apart so that a timing change never rewrites an agent's
judgement and an agent's judgement never reaches into the loop's mechanism.

Nine verbs, all optional, each answered against a ``StepView``: fourteen
read-only fields where the hook context had fourteen writable ones. What a
participant returns is the whole of its effect -- a text to go in, a narrower tool
array to go out, a note, a verdict, a salvaged reply, the reply to send -- and
it holds no handle to the transcript, the window's state, or the loop.

One instance per turn. The plugin's entry point returns a ``ParticipantFactory``
and the host calls it at each turn's start, so what this turn has already done
is an attribute on ``self`` and dies with the turn. A plugin no longer keeps
turn state in the hook context's free-form ``metadata`` dict: the host parks
the participant there and the plugin never reads it.

Pure data on purpose. A participant is not only a plugin: a dispatch's own

host reads these into its own shapes, vets them there, and treats a mapping it

        ``review`` at the ``execute_tools`` phase. Wiring the seat's
