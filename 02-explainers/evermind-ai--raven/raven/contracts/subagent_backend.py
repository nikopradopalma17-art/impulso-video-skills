    the spawn semaphore, and rate limiting are the manager's concern, not the
    backend's.

    ``mode`` is the operating profile to run under, for a transport that has
    one. Only ``acp`` does; the others accept it and ignore it, the way they
    already do with ``provider`` / ``model`` -- the manager passes one keyword
    set to whichever backend it resolved, so a backend missing the parameter
    fails the dispatch with a TypeError before the agent is ever contacted.

    once at exit and cannot be made to stream by declaring that it does. Same
    rule as ``AgentMeta.live_progress``.

    False by default so a duck-typed backend is read as non-streaming; the
    manager then never wires ``on_delta``, and the caller falls back to
    delivering the return value whole. Nothing else in the stack branches on it.
