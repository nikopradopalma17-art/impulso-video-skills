"""The seam through which a plugin contributes a screen to ``raven onboard``.

The host owns the wizard shell (console, translation, prompt helpers, the
back sentinel) and what only the host knows about providers (the lender of an
already-configured provider's credentials, and what the main chat model
resolves to), and hands the lot over as one ``OnboardUI``. The plugin owns
the screen's content. The plugin never writes ``memory.backend``: it returns a
``StepOutcome`` and the host records the choice, so the host's config key
stays the host's.
