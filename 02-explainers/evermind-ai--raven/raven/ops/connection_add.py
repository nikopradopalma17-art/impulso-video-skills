"""The write half of the machine registry: reach a machine, then write it down.

:mod:`raven.ops.connections` reads the owner's machines and stays read-only on
purpose. This module is the one door that adds a row, and it is the same door
whichever surface knocks: the owner in a terminal (``raven ops connection
add``), or an agent that was told about a machine in conversation
(``ops_connection_add``). Until 2026-09-06 the host ran the command on the
owner's behalf before dispatching a sub-agent; that step went with the
pre-dispatch registry gate, and the write moved to the on-call product's own
plugin. It sits here now because the coding agent runs on the owner's machines
too -- it builds a case where the solver is and smoke-tests it there -- and a
second copy of the probe in a second plugin is the drift this tree already paid
for once (five byte-identical registries on one computer, 2026-08-25).

Two things keep what the owner is asked short. What a machine can say about
itself -- cores, memory, devices -- is read off it once reached, never typed.
And what the owner leaves out of the way in -- port, username, key path -- is
resolved the way their own terminal would resolve it (``ssh -G``, config
blocks included), then tried: the probe decides, and only what connected is
written. Nothing is written until the machine itself answers; an unreachable
row in the registry is a fact every later turn acts on, an absent one is a
question the loop knows to ask.

Optional, only if they care to say: what is installed on it (with paths),
which directories on it hold their work, and how its budget is counted.

With the answers, call ops_connection_add: it reaches the machine before
writing anything, and what the machine says about itself is read off it.
