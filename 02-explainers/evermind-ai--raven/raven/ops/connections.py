"""The machines this instance can reach, named by their owner.

A campaign that carries its own ``host``/``port``/``key`` puts the way in
inside the thing being run, and leaves the agent to work the connection out for
itself: a statement that does not spell the port out sends it guessing through
22, 2222, 8022, ``~/.ssh/config`` and a stale ``known_hosts`` entry.

None of that is the agent being slow. It had no way to reach a machine except to
guess at one, so guessing is what it did.

Here a machine is something the owner sets up once and names -- "my CPU box",
"the GPU machine" -- and the agent only ever sees the name and what the machine
is. Three things follow:

  * a task statement stops carrying infrastructure. "run it on my CPU box" is
    what a person types, and there is no address in it to guess at;
  * a name is the only thing that can tell two machines apart when they share an
    address. 14.103.100.27:58717 and 14.103.100.27:64101 are different machines,
    and "on 14.103.100.27" names neither of them;
  * properties that belong to a machine live on the machine. Which unit its
    budget is counted in, and how many jobs it will run at once, were being
    restated in every campaign's meta and in the task statement itself.

Credentials stay a reference -- a path to a key the owner already has. Passwords
wait until there is a platform that needs them (2026-08-17, deliberate): storing
one means a keychain or a master password, and neither is worth building before
something asks for it.

Read-only here: the file is written by hand or through
:mod:`raven.ops.connection_add`, the one door behind both ``raven ops
connection add`` and the ``ops_connection_add`` tool. What an agent is *shown*
beyond :func:`shown`, and how a campaign is given a way onto the machine it
names, belong to that agent's own installation; what this module offers a
caller is the store behind the owner's command, the faults that make a row
unusable, and the projection (:func:`shown`) that keeps an address out of
whatever gets handed on.
