"""Command runners for registered machines, so nothing above this has to know.

A machine the owner registered is not always a different computer. Someone who
writes their own solver usually runs it where they wrote it and installs raven
on that same box: there is no host to reach and no key to present, and a
command is simply run. Measured need, 2026-08-18 -- the CFD group's in-house
Fortran code lives on the machine raven would be installed on.

Everything above this seam names a connection and nothing else. Which runner
answers is a property of the row (``connections.transport_of``), so a tool
call reads the same whether the work runs across the room or in this process's
own filesystem.
