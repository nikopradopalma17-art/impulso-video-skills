"""Runtime capability probes for provider/model pairs.

Two questions that look alike but are not:

* *Can the model see images at all?* — a model property.
* *Can an image ride inside a tool result?* — a wire-format property. A
  vision model reached over OpenAI's Chat Completions cannot: that API types
  ``role:"tool"`` content as ``string | ChatCompletionContentPartText[]``, so an
  image block has nowhere to go. Anthropic's ``tool_result.content`` accepts
  ``image``, and the Responses API accepts an array on
  ``function_call_output.output``.

The second question decides whether ``read_file`` hands the model a picture or a
text placeholder plus a follow-up attachment, so it is answered per target, not
per model.

The first is :func:`supports_vision`, answered per model from the gateway
catalog. Both have to be asked: a model that cannot see is not helped by a
transport that could have carried the picture, and a model that can see still
loses it over a transport that cannot.

    The other half of this module's opening question, and the one that decides
    whether a picture is inlined into the user message or replaced by a note
    telling the model to read it another way.

    Answered from the gateway catalog Raven already fetches and caches for
    token rates (:func:`raven.providers.rates.openrouter_input_modalities`), which
    publishes ``input_modalities`` for every model it lists. That completeness is
    the reason it is the source rather than LiteLLM's price table: the table
    states ``supports_vision`` on under a third of its rows, and reading the
    silence on the other two thirds as a denial would take a picture that reaches
    Grok, Llama 4 and the Qwen-VL family today and replace it with prose.

    No entry at all means yes, which leaves the model exactly where it was before
    this function existed. Being wrong that way is loud -- the endpoint refuses
    the request and the turn fails. Being wrong the other way is silent: the
    picture never arrives and the model answers from the surrounding text as
    though it had seen one. There is no automatic recovery in either direction on
    the attachment path (``should_drop_tool_images`` rescues an image out of a
    *tool result*, not out of a user message), so the choice is between a visible
    failure and an invisible one. :attr:`ProviderSpec.vision_override` settles a
    model the catalog gets wrong or never lists.

    The catalog is read from cache only, never fetched here, so on a cold install
    the first answers are the optimistic default while a background warm fills
    it. The rates ladder cannot be left to do that warming -- it reaches this
    catalog only for models LiteLLM's static table misses, which excludes every
    model Raven ships a default for.

    Two different reasons, and the model has to be told them apart. By default

    ``describe_tool`` names that tool, or is ``None`` when the caller has none to
    offer: it is contributed by the EverOS plugin and absent on a default
