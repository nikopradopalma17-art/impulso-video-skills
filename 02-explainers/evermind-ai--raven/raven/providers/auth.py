"""How a provider is connected to: what material it needs, and whether it is there.

A provider's requirement is an AND of OR-groups: Azure needs a key *and* an
address; Gemini takes a key *or* a list of them; Bedrock needs neither because
the environment already holds AWS credentials; four providers hold a token in a
file, written by three unrelated flows. Callers ask :func:`credential_status`
rather than reading a section themselves, because an unstated shape is answered
independently wherever it is needed, and the answers diverge. Routing skipped
a Gemini section configured with ``api_key_list``; ``provider list`` showed the
same section as ready; startup refused to run on it. Azure with a key and no
address was accepted by routing and display and rejected at startup.

So the requirement is declared here, once, as **an AND of OR-groups**: every
group must be satisfied, and any member satisfies its group. That is the whole
grammar, and it is enough for all eight shapes -- "key and address" is two
groups, "key or key list" is one group with two members.

Callers ask :func:`credential_status`. What they must not do is re-derive the
answer from spec flags, which is what produced the divergence.
