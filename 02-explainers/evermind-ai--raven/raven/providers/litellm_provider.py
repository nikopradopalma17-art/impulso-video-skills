        For a direct instance, this only vetoes the one case both sides are

        non-OAuth spec, the model resolves to a *different* known spec, and

            recognizes natively but Raven has no ProviderSpec for, e.g.
            nebius/fireworks/together) -- there is nothing to compare against;
          - the resolved spec is OAuth-based (e.g. github_copilot): one OAuth
            grant can serve several upstream vendors, so a spec mismatch there
            says nothing about whether this instance can serve the model;
          - the model resolves to no spec at all (custom endpoints, bare ids
            only LiteLLM itself recognizes).
        In all of those, the model is not known to be wrong for this

        which the spec-based guess below is wrong -- a per-model routing
        endpoint is built with ``provider_name="custom"`` for its api_base /
        api_key shape alone, not because the backend behind it is known to be a

        every one of its responses.

        normalization exists for. When nothing was auto-detected, fall back to
        whatever spec ``provider_name`` resolves to.

        An identity that resolves to nothing answers False, the same reading
        ``can_serve`` settled on: an unresolved name says nothing about the
        backend, and several production constructors (the proactive planner,
        the evolver) build direct big-vendor connections with no

        genuinely self-hosted backend is reached through ``custom`` or a
        local spec, which is where the parser-less sglang/vLLM shape comes
