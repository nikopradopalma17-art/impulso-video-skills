"""What a tool name may be, and what to do with one that is not.

The constraint is the providers', which is why it lives here rather than beside
any one of the subsystems that has to satisfy it. Verified against three
independent sources, because getting the character set wrong is silent rather
than loud:

- Anthropic Messages API: ``name`` must match ``^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$``.
- OpenAI: "a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or contain underscores and dashes, maximum length 64".
- litellm, the path raven actually takes, rewrites only names that are already
  illegal and truncates at 128 -- so a 100-char legal name passes litellm and is
  rejected by Anthropic. The 64 cap has to be enforced by us.

Two directions, and they must not share a function. Outbound -- assembling a
name to send, which is :mod:`raven.mcp.naming` -- may substitute an illegal
character, because it is constructing a name and the result is what it then
registers. Inbound -- reading a name a model sent back -- may not: substituting
there invents a name nobody declared. ``sanitary_form(" read_file")`` is
``"_read_file"`` and ``sanitary_form("read file")`` is ``"read_file"``, and
either one used on a received name answers "that tool does not exist" with a
guess.

    Surrounding whitespace comes off and nothing else does. Whitespace is

    any -- which makes removing it a fact about the name rather than a guess
    about intent. Interior spaces and case differences stay, and still miss:
    ``read_file`` and ``Read_File`` can both be registered at once, so folding
    them would answer "that tool does not exist" with a guess, and that answer
    is only worth something while it is certain.

    Asked at the parse exits rather than at the registry lookup because the name
    outlives the lookup. It is written back into the history by
    ``providers.tool_calls.openai_tool_call``, where a bad one is replayed to the
    model every turn afterwards, and it keys the failure streak, the tool events
    and the logs -- each of which would otherwise need an allowance of its own,
    and one of them would be missed.

    A name that is not a string is handed back untouched. That is a different
    fault with a different owner, and raising would take down the parse of a
