"""One way in to the ChatGPT (Codex) credential LiteLLM's driver owns.

LiteLLM ships the device flow, the refresh and the account-id derivation for this
provider, so raven stops carrying its own: what is left to decide is where the
file lives and how to read it without starting a login.

That last part is the reason this module exists rather than three call sites
reaching for ``Authenticator``. Its ``get_access_token`` starts a device flow
whenever it cannot produce a token -- correct for ``provider login``, wrong for a
status report or a request the user is waiting on, where it prints a code to
stdout and polls for fifteen minutes.
