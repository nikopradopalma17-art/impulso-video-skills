"""Reading a call's transport facts off the client library, bounded and scrubbed.

The machinery behind :class:`raven.contracts.llm_provider.CallRecord`. Everything
it reads was already in hand at the provider boundary and was dropped before the
tracing extractor ran: the status code survived only as an
``ErrorClassification.category``, the response headers were never read at all,
and the serving backend -- which OpenRouter names in the body -- went out with
the parsed response object. So a failure that says nothing on its own
(HTTP 200, empty content, ``finish_reason: "stop"``, usage all zeros) left a
record that could not distinguish a gateway refusing a payload from one backend
of a fallback order misbehaving.

Three constraints shape what is kept:

* **Bounded.** A record sits beside a prompt that can already be tens of
  megabytes; it must not add a second copy of anything. The body is capped, the
  headers are capped in count and in value length, and a record never carries
  the request.
* **No credentials.** Response headers are kept by exclusion rather than by an
  allow list -- the header that explains an incident is exactly the one an allow
  list would not have thought of -- so the name is tested against
  :data:`_SECRET_HEADER` and a hit keeps the name with its value replaced. The
  body goes through :func:`_scrub`, deliberately a handful of patterns rather
  than the full table in ``raven.security.redact``: a response body is not a
  config file. The one realistic echo is a 401 quoting the request's own
  ``Authorization`` header, which is what the patterns are chosen for.
* **No image payloads.** A picture reaches here only inside the request, which
  this module never touches. How many rode along and what they weighed is
  counted on the ``llm.input`` side, from the messages, by
  ``raven.observability.semconv``.
