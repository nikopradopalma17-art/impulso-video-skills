"""Lazy LLM provider: defer building the real provider until the first model call.

Building the real provider imports litellm (~2-7s), which — when done eagerly at
``AgentLoop`` construction — stalls startup even though tools/skills/memory do not
need it. ``LazyProvider`` answers the two things read before the first call
(``get_default_model`` and ``generation``) from config, and builds the real
provider (memoized, thread-safe) only when a chat method is actually invoked.
