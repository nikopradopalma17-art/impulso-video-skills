"""What a model is called, what it can do, and what it is for.

A picker showing `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` is showing an identifier. What a
person choosing a model wants is its name, roughly what it is good at, what it
can take in and hand back, and how recent it is -- none of which LiteLLM's table
carries, because that table exists to price and route.

So there are two catalogue sources and they answer different questions:

* LiteLLM's own table decides prices and limits used in a request. It ships with
  the dependency and needs no network. It also carries capability flags, which
  Raven deliberately does not read: its `supports_prompt_caching` asks whether a
  model caches at all, while what a request needs to know is whether the provider
  accepts `cache_control` blocks -- `ProviderSpec`'s field of the same name.
* the bundled provider registry (`providers/registry_data.py`, three packaged
  files) decides labels and display tags, and prices a finished call. It carries
  a name, a one-line description, what the model reads and writes, and the
  vendor's published cost. The context window is deliberately absent: it sizes
  trimming, which shapes the *next* request, so `providers/rates.py` answers it
  from the tables that also route.

Keeping the split is the point rather than an implementation detail. The registry
is community-maintained data; if it goes stale, wrong, or missing, the cost is a
model shown by its id instead of its name, a missing icon, or a total that is
off. It can never cause a wrong request, because nothing that shapes one reads it.

A capability tag is display only, and specifically not the answer to "may this
request carry an image". That question is `capabilities.supports_vision`, which
reads a catalogue Raven fetches for rates, and `ProviderSpec`, which knows what
the wire can hold -- a model that can see is still not reachable with a picture
over a transport with nowhere to put one.

The registry ships with Raven so a fresh install labels models offline and tests
never reach the network. Regenerate with
``scripts/refresh_provider_registry.py``.
