"""Start a vendor's device-code sign-in without a console.

The CLI runs each vendor's flow to completion in the terminal that asked for
it. A page cannot: it needs the verification URL and the user code the moment
the vendor hands them out, and the polling has to go on after the reply is
sent. :func:`start` runs the vendor's own flow in a thread, hands the pair back
as soon as it exists and leaves the thread polling until the token lands or
the code expires. ``model.options`` reports the outcome the way it always did:
``authenticated`` flips once the credential file exists.
