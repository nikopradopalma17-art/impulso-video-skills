"""Curated "common models" shortlist per provider slug.

Hand-maintained on purpose. Provider ``/v1/models`` endpoints return the full
catalog (OpenRouter alone ships 300+ models) with no "popular"/"common" flag,
so a small, recognizable default set has to be curated rather than derived.

The TUI ``/model`` picker shows this shortlist *after* whatever the user has
configured in ``config.providers.<slug>.models``; users can always type any
model id by hand (``model.add_model``), so this list only needs to cover the
common case, not every model.

Model ids drift as providers ship releases -- update the ``curated`` array of
``data/provider-models.json`` as needed, where a row also carries the tags and
the canonical model a shortlist entry points at. Providers with no curated rows
fall back to their configured list.
