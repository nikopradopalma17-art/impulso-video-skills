"""Import litellm with its terminal noise silenced, at import and afterwards.

litellm prints a "Provider List" banner (gated by ``suppress_debug_info``) and,
because it installs its own stderr ``StreamHandler`` on its ``LiteLLM*`` loggers,
emits DEBUG to the terminal *while importing*. Raise those loggers' levels across
the import so that DEBUG never reaches the terminal, then restore them.

Then detach that handler for good. raven's ``_strip_tty_stream_handlers`` cannot
do it: it runs while the CLI sets up logging, and every litellm import in raven is
deferred, so the handler is installed *after* the strip has already run and
nothing removes it. What follows is a session where every litellm record --
including DEBUG, because raven's stdlib intercept sets the root level to 0 -- is
written straight to the terminal, over the Ink screen. Detaching leaves the
records propagating to root, so they still reach the log file sink.
