"""On-disk persistence for the model catalog (per-model pricing + context window).

A single versioned JSON file under ``~/.raven/cache/``, written atomically
(temp-file + ``os.replace``) so concurrent multi-process readers never observe a
torn file. The catalog is a disposable, refetchable whole-blob cache with an
authoritative network source, so a lost write race just costs one extra refetch
— no lock is needed.

Named after what it persists (the model catalog), not its source: the storage
layer is source-agnostic, so a future catalog source reuses it unchanged. This
is the storage layer only; freshness (TTL), the in-process tier, and the actual
fetch are the caller's concern (see ``providers.rates._fetch_openrouter_models``).
