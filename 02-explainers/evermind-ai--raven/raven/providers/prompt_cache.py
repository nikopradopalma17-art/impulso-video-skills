"""Whether a request may carry Anthropic-shaped ``cache_control`` breakpoints.

One question, asked from three places -- the provider that builds the request,
and the two token strategies that place breakpoints before it -- and answered
here once, so the three cannot disagree about where a breakpoint may go.

The answer is **(wire x model family)**, not the wire alone:

* the wire has to have somewhere to put the field. An OpenAI-shaped API does
  not, and a gateway speaks its own shape regardless of who it fronts, so
  ``ProviderSpec.supports_prompt_caching`` is asked of whatever the request is
  actually addressed to.
* the model has to be one whose vendor reads it. A gateway accepts the field for
  every model it fronts and forwards it to vendors that do not: it is then billed
  as an unrecognized block rather than refused, which doubles a prompt silently.

Suppression is the fourth answer, and it is learned rather than declared,
because no table here can predict it. See ``suppress``.

    ``addressed_to`` is the provider actually serving the request, for the one

    ``find_by_model`` on an id whose prefix nobody claims -- in both cases there

    rejection is learned at runtime and this guess never gets a second try for
