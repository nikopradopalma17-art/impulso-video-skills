"""Provider that dispatches each call to the vendor adapter its model resolves to.

Per-session model selection means two concurrent turns can want two different
vendors, so a single baked-in adapter (whose api_key / api_base are fixed at
construction) is not enough. This resolves the vendor per call from the model
name via ``Config.get_provider_name``, so ``AgentLoop.provider`` never has to be
swapped -- which would tear an in-flight turn in another session.

Sub-providers are LazyProvider-wrapped: a vendor's litellm build is paid on its
first actual call, not up front for every configured vendor.
