"""Rotate and fail over across a provider section's several endpoints.

``provider_endpoints`` (see ``raven.providers.endpoints``) resolves a section
into one or more ``ResolvedEndpoint``s -- several accounts on the same
vendor, several regions, several keys. This module is the behavior asked
of that list: spread requests across them (round-robin) or stick
to one until it misbehaves (sticky), and route around an endpoint that just
failed instead of sending the next request into the same wall.

State (which endpoint is cooling, how many times it has failed, the rotation
cursor) lives in process memory only -- see ``RotorState`` for why, which is
the same reasoning as ``prompt_cache._SUPPRESSED``.

A stream in progress is never switched mid-flight. Rotation only ever
happens before the caller has seen a token: an exception or an error-shaped
terminal delta arriving before the first real delta means nothing has been
said yet, so trying the next endpoint costs nothing. Once a normal first
delta has been handed to the caller, part of an answer already exists;
resuming it from a different endpoint would either duplicate or contradict
what was already sent, so a failure past that point is raised as-is and the
stream ends there, same as any single-endpoint provider's stream would.
