"""Did the upstream actually answer, or only say that it had.

Beside :mod:`raven.providers.truncation` and for its reasons: everything read
here belongs to this layer, and the non-streaming caller has to reach it
*before* returning, while the ``llm.call`` span is still open.

The fault it exists for: an upstream can mark a call failed in the response
body -- ``finish_reason=error`` over HTTP 200, with nothing in it -- and the
client library rewrites that to ``stop`` from a lookup table, in place and
without a log line (litellm 1.97.0, ``core_helpers.py``: ``"error": "stop"``;
``gpt_transformation.py`` overwrites the field, and no public field keeps the
original). Raven's retry ladder gates on ``finish_reason != "error"``, so it
read the call as healthy and neither retried, classified nor fell back. In the
control experiment the same request succeeded on the next backend, so this was
a blip one retry would have healed.

Two verdicts, asked in that order. The client library keeps a copy of the value
it renamed (``provider_specific_fields["native_finish_reason"]``, written in
``Choices.__init__``), so wherever a response was assembled through that
constructor the upstream's own word is still readable and nothing has to be
inferred. Where it was not -- several vendors map the reason and assign it to an
already-built choice, destroying the original -- the accounting evidence is all
there is.

Either way a response that delivered something is left alone: the invariant is
that a failure must be *visible*, not that a usable answer be thrown away.

Both response paths ask this, for the reason ``truncation`` gives for its own
question: a verdict reached on one path and not the other makes the same fault
read differently inside the TUI than outside it.

    ``native_finish_reason`` outside :data:`_NORMAL_STOP_ALIASES` settles it on
    its own. It is the value the upstream actually sent, kept by the library
    beside the one it rewrote, so there is nothing to corroborate.

    * Silence with honest usage is a model that said nothing. The agent loop
      recovers that by changing the request (a prefill, a post-tool nudge) or
      retrying it, and none of that is reachable once a response is reported as
      an error. Retrying the identical request, which is all this verdict can
      ask for, is also the one thing that does not help there.
    * An answer with strange accounting is an answer. Gateways under-report
      usage, and a verdict that overrode a real reply would trade this fault
      for a worse one.

    ``reasoning_content`` is not weighed either way -- see
    :func:`said_nothing`. When the two signals disagree the accounting is the
    truthful one, because a prompt that was never read cannot have been
    reasoned about.

    So a laundered failure whose accounting looks ordinary is not caught here.
    That is deliberate: locally it is indistinguishable from a silent model,
    and the loop already has a recovery for exactly that shape.

    ``finish_reason`` must be the value the upstream actually sent, not one
    synthesised when it sent none. A stream that yields no terminal delta at
    all is a different situation with its own settled behaviour, and widening
    to cover it would change a case nobody reported.
