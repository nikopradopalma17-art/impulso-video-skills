"""Account every model call once, at the provider seam.

The usage file (``<raven home>/telemetry/usage-*.jsonl``) is written by
``UsageTracker``, and the tracker only hears the calls somebody hands it. For a
long time that was the turn loop and image generation alone, while some forty
other callers -- the heartbeat, the sentinel, memory consolidation, session
titles, the permission judge, the playbook planner, the in-process sub-agent's
own loop -- called a provider directly and were never billed anywhere.

So the recording happens here instead, around the calls themselves:
:func:`instrument` wraps every provider class's ``chat``, ``chat_with_retry``
and ``chat_stream`` (``raven.providers.base.LLMProvider`` applies it to each
subclass), and the sink bound for the calling context hears each call once.

Which sink a call goes to is decided in two steps. A caller that *is* a
generation binds its own registry for the calls it makes (:func:`bind`, entered
by the loop for the turn it is about to run); everything else -- the heartbeat,
the sentinel, consolidation, a session title, the judge -- reports to the
process-wide default :func:`install` was given.

The two-step is what keeps a generation swap honest. A candidate is built while
the generation it replaces may still be serving (a candidate that later fails to
assemble, or one overlapping its predecessor's shutdown grace), so the loop
binds its own registry per turn rather than trusting whichever assembly ran
last: the serving generation's turns are billed to the serving generation,
throughout a build that fails.

Once, in three senses:

- **Nested wrappers record at the outermost entry.** ``ResolvingProvider``,
  ``PerModelProvider`` and ``LazyProvider`` delegate to an inner provider, and
  the base retry ladder calls ``chat`` for every attempt; the outermost call
  marks the context as owned, and every inner entry passes straight through.
  The outermost call is the one whose answer the caller received, so a retried
  or fallen-back call is one row, under the response that came back -- the same
  unit the turn loop has always recorded.
- **A caller that records the call itself says so.** A caller that makes one
  call and records it can run it inside :func:`recorded_by_caller` and nothing
  here records it a second time. The turn loop does *not* do that: one Action
  decision may make several calls (best-of-n, a critic pass), and a claim over
  the whole decision would lose every call but the one returned. The seam
  records each of them instead, and the loop skips its own row while any call
  behind it was recorded -- :func:`recorded_inbound`, which counts the calls
  made under this context rather than comparing registries. A registry
  comparison is what made a swap bill one call twice: the serving generation's
  `after_llm_call` no longer matched a process-wide sink that a candidate build
  had already replaced, so the call was recorded by the seam into the
  candidate's tracker and again by the loop into its own.
- **A stream is one row, recorded when it is exhausted.** Usage and the finish
  reason may arrive on different deltas, so neither alone is the trigger. The
  wrapper nearest the wire owns the stream: it marks the deltas it passes on,
  and a wrapper that finds the first delta already marked is yielding an inner
  provider's stream and records nothing. A stream abandoned before its end is
  not recorded -- its usage never arrived.

A call that failed before reaching a model -- an error response carrying no
usage -- is not recorded: nothing was spent, and a row of zeros would read as a
cheap call. A call that raised has no response to record.

With no sink installed and none bound, nothing is recorded, which is what an
entry point that assembles no runtime (``raven doctor``, a unit test) wants.
