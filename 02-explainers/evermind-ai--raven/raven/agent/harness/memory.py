"""The default Memory strategy: the window this turn's model calls see.

The context engine stays the thing that assembles -- it holds the Curator's
working state and each segment builder's provider binding, and the builders
were sized against this generation's context window, so a generation's window
*is* its engine and replacing it is a new generation. What this module adds is
the seat: the loop asks the Memory role rather than reaching past it, and the
turn-side decisions that were never the shell's live here with it.

``candidate_messages`` turns on ``owns_compaction``, which is this role's own
property: an engine that archives for itself wants the whole append-only log
so it can decide what to evict, one that does not wants the post-consolidation
slice so the view matches what the consolidator left behind.

``token_budget`` sizes the prompt against the model's own ceiling, which is the
window's arithmetic by definition -- and the five things it reads (provider,
model, window, tool definitions, identity builder) are the same five the engine
itself was constructed with, so this is the logic returning to the role that
owns it rather than new coupling. All five are read through callables because
all five move under a live ``/model`` switch or a hot config apply, and a value
captured at assembly would answer for the retired one.

Still with the shell on purpose: the assembly orchestration around ``assemble``
(building the TurnContext, save for the brief this role fills in; the
degraded-segment stash; the injected-skill bookkeeping the loop reads back
afterwards). Half of that is the window's and half is the shell's, so it is
not a move this role can make honestly.

``shrink`` is the window's mid-turn seat: the five ways a transcript is made to
fit again (see ``raven.agent.window.shrink``), asked for by the loop under a
``WindowPressure`` and answered against a ``WindowState`` the loop carries. The
policy -- what to give up, when a summary is worth paying for -- lives here;
the retry itself (re-entering the iteration) stays with the loop, so the hooks
see a retried call exactly as they saw the first.
