"""How the default roles read what several participants say about one step.

One place for the merge rules, read by the default modules and by a seat that
runs before any harness is bound (a plugin test driving its hook directly).
The rules are the hook composite's, restated over verbs: the first participant
that ends or resamples a step decides it; advice is joined in order with a
blank line; the first salvaged reply stands; an intake threads the text through
every participant until one ends the turn.

This is also where a participant's answer stops being pure data and becomes
something the shell can act on. Every verb hands back a mapping or None, so
that a generated function can answer as well as a plugin can; the readers here
vet those mappings and drop what they cannot read. A malformed answer is
silence, never a refusal -- the third invariant -- so a participant cannot
escalate by answering badly.
