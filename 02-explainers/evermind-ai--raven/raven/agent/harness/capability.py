"""The default Capability strategy: the registry's own view, unchanged.

``ToolRegistry.get_definitions`` is already the answer to "what does this
iteration show the model" -- it applies the session overlay, the withheld
set, the schema-hidden declarations, the dynamic-schema tools and this
turn's registered names, in that order. So the default reads it and reports
it, which keeps the array the model receives byte-identical to the array it
received before this seam existed.

The registry is asked per iteration rather than captured once because it is
live within a turn in one direction: a tool can be turned off mid-turn (the
withheld union only grows), while a late registration does not appear until
the next turn -- the array is the prompt-cache prefix and must not move
between two model calls of one turn.
