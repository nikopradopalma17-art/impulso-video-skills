"""What each credential-bearing tool needs, in one place.

Providers have had a declarative credential model for a while --
``providers.auth`` names what each connection method requires and
``credential_status`` is the single authority on whether a provider is usable.
An AST invariant enforces that authority, because six surfaces once answered
the same question six ways and each looked reasonable alone.

Tools never got the equivalent. Three rules decide whether a tool is offered to
the model, one per family, each a different shape:

    web_search   a resolved key, asked of the built tool
    web_fetch    nothing -- always registered, a key only improves extraction
    media x3     an api_key *or* a model, either one counting as configured

For the media family, being offered to the model and being usable are two
different questions: a section naming only a model is offered, because a
model alone counts as asking for the tool, and then every call fails on a
missing key. :func:`is_configured` answers the first and the tools' ``has_key``
answers the second -- collapsing them is how a report ends up ticking a
capability that cannot run.

Each rule is defensible where it sits. What is missing is anywhere to *read*
them. A deployer cannot ask what this install lacks, and since an unconfigured
tool is withheld from the model there is no surface at all saying the
capability exists: the model is not offered it, no document lists it, and
``raven doctor`` reports on providers and memory but has never mentioned tools.

This module is that surface. It describes the rules rather than replacing them
-- ``is_configured`` mirrors the loop's judgement instead of inventing a second
one -- and ``tests/test_tool_capabilities.py`` pins the description against what
the loop actually offers, so the two cannot drift apart quietly. Drifting
descriptions of the same fact is the failure this exists to avoid repeating.
