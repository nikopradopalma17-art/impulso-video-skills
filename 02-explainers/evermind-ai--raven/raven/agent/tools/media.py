"""Image preprocessing for tool results that carry pictures.

Vision endpoints reject or silently degrade images that are too large in any of
three independent ways — pixel dimensions, encoded byte size, and billed patch
count — so a picture has to clear all three before it can ride in a tool result.
The ceilings here are the strictest across the providers Raven targets, because
one payload gets built per turn and may be sent to any of them:

* 2000px per side — Anthropic downscales above 1568px and multi-image requests
  are observed to fail past ~2000px.
* 4.5MB of base64 — under the 5MB per-image cap that Bedrock and Vertex AI
  enforce (the direct Anthropic API allows 10MB, but the payload must satisfy
  the lowest common denominator).
* 1568 patch tokens — the standard-tier per-image ceiling. Anthropic's docs are
  explicit that *both* limits apply ("Images larger than either limit are
  downscaled"), so checking pixels alone lets an image through that still gets
  resized server-side, which makes any local token estimate wrong.
