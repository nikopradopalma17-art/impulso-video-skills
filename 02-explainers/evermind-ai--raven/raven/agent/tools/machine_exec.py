"""Run one command on a machine the owner registered.

``exec`` runs on the computer the loop itself lives on. The owner's code and
their cases live on the machines in the connection registry, which may be a
different box or may be this one -- and the credentials for a different box
belong to the connection rather than to the loop. So "what is in that
directory / what did the solver print / how big is that output" is answered
here, by naming the machine, and ``exec`` routes to this the moment it is
given one.

This channel exists so the address never has to: with no ``machine``
parameter, every remote look is a raw ``ssh -p <port> root@<ip> ...`` typed
from an address the task statement had to carry -- measured 2026-09-03, a
whole field run where the registry's own projection (id and capabilities, no
host, no port, no key) was bypassed on every call because the raw address sat
in context. The registry resolves the id here, below the model.

Two things this refuses that a plain shell would not:

**Anything that outlives the call.** ``nohup``, a trailing ``&``, ``screen``,
``tmux``, ``at``, ``crontab``: on a registered machine, work that keeps
running belongs to a governed job runner (the on-call agent's ``ops_submit``),
which is what makes its budget enforceable, its state survive a restart, and
its results arrive when they are due. On the loop's own computer there is no
ledger to escape, so the plain shell keeps that freedom.

**Anything slower than a look.** Every command is capped, and the cap is
enforced on the machine itself so a kill reaches both ends -- a cap that only
killed the local ssh client left the remote process running (measured
2026-09-02: an orphaned training run held a GPU at 100% after its local
caller died). Something that needs longer is a job, and a job has a different
home.

The refusal above is a hint, not the fence. The fence is that the command runs
in a process group of its own and the group is stopped when the call ends,
whether the shell finished or the cap fired: reviewed 2026-09-07, a command
that backgrounded something with output redirected (``python train.py > log
2>&1 & echo ok``) slipped past the old ``&``-at-the-end guard, and a remote
``timeout`` wrapper had nothing left to kill once the shell's foreground half
had returned -- the call reported exit 0 in under a second while the child ran
on unbounded. Now the wrapper sweeps the group afterwards and says so in the
output, so a detach that was not refused is still not a detach.
