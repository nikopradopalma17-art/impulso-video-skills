"""``create_playbook`` — capture a procedure from the conversation as a playbook.

The conversational half of the creation story (the other is ``raven playbook
create``): when the user asks to save a workflow they just described or ran,
the agent hands the description to the same generator the CLI uses, and the
product lands in the same place under the same rules — the user layer of the
library, enabled and handed to the live runtime as soon as it passes validation.

The tool takes a description, never a spec: generation, validation and repair
stay inside :class:`PlaybookGenerator`, so a model cannot write an arbitrary
graph into the library through this tool.
