"""In-turn transcript compaction helpers for long agentic turns.

A tool-heavy turn appends results for tens of iterations while the context is
assembled only once, so the working transcript grows until it hits the model's
window. The reactive half of that problem -- on a provider's overflow error,
elide older tool-result bodies and retry (``shrink.emergency_shrink``) -- and
the proactive half below are both decided by the Memory role; this module
carries the pure pieces of the proactive half, read only when
``agents.defaults.compaction.enabled`` is on:

- trigger arithmetic: when the last observed context size crosses the line
  (``should_compact`` / ``reserved_tokens``), act before the next call instead
  of waiting for the overflow;
- head summary: replace everything between the first user message and a
  recent verbatim tail with one LLM-written handoff brief (``select_split`` /
  ``render_transcript`` / ``build_compacted``); the tail budget comes from
  ``tail_budget``.

The MemoryConsolidator operates at turn boundaries and never runs inside a
turn; this module, ``shrink.emergency_shrink`` and the standing image window
(``shrink.window_images``, which retires pictures the model has already looked at
before every call) are the only in-turn mechanisms.

# began. Measured against a real head in that same band -- 158 messages, 46860
# chars -- the brief this produces is 1466 completion tokens behind 25
# reasoning tokens, so the model's own stopping point decides the length and
# 32000 is about twenty times what it reaches for.
#
# The other thing headroom buys is that a brief is never cut mid-sentence,

    trigger: the head being summarized is precisely what did not fit, so the
