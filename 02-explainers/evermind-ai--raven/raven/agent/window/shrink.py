"""How the window gets smaller mid-turn: the five operations and their bounds.

A tool-heavy turn appends results for tens of iterations while the context is
assembled once, so the working transcript grows until it hits the model's
window. These are the ways it is made to fit again -- eliding older tool
bodies, moving or withdrawing pictures, summarising the head -- and the bounds
on how often a turn may pay for each. Pure over the message list (the head
summary takes the provider it is to call as an argument), so the loop that
retries and the Memory role that decides can both read them, and neither has
to import the other.

Every operation is prefix-stable where it can be (see ``window_images``): a
withdrawn message is byte for byte what it was, because the request prefix is
what an upstream cache matches.

    Two modes. Without ``budget``, every image-bearing message but the newest
    ``keep`` loses its pictures: the shape the overflow path and the refusal
    ladder want. With ``budget`` (base64 bytes, the size the pictures have on the
    wire and what the request body is charged), nothing happens while the pictures
    still live in the transcript fit under it, and the moment they do not, every
    message but the newest ``keep`` loses its pictures at once.
    A collapse rather than a slide because each withdrawal is a break in the
    prefix an upstream cache can match: sliding one message out per new batch
    broke the prefix on 16 of 60 calls in one measured run (19 of 41 in the
    other) and the hit rate went from 84.5% to 64.7%; collapsing when the
    budget is hit breaks it once or a handful of times per deck, and the
    pictures stay in view for longer in between.

    In place: each withdrawn message is replaced in ``messages`` by a copy whose
    image parts have become notes (:func:`withdrawn_image_note`), so what the
    model has been told about a picture it can no longer see is part of the
    transcript from then on, not something recomputed per request.

    Prefix-stable by construction. A message is touched only while it still
    carries a picture, so one withdrawn on an earlier iteration is byte for
    byte what it was; between two iterations either nothing changes or one
    collapse does. That is the property a cached prefix needs, and the reason
    this is not a pure function returning a fresh list.

    The pictures tools showed, on either transport: a ``tool`` message where
    the endpoint carries them there, the following ``user`` message the loop
    attached where it does not. A picture the user sent is the subject of the
    turn rather than a result, and stays -- unless ``any_role``, which is for
    the request the endpoint has already refused, when there is nothing else
    left to take out. Remote references count toward ``keep`` but weigh
    nothing in the budget: their size is unknowable without fetching them.

    the model keeps its most recent working state. The summary runs on the
    turn's own provider and model: a pinned summary model would outlive a
    model switch and then route every summary to a retired endpoint.

    It does not run at the turn's own reasoning effort. That was the shape
    first written -- a model call of the turn like any other -- and the
    reason it has to go is that the two are not alike: a turn thinks in
    order to decide, while a handoff brief is a transcript read back, and
    thinking is spent from the same budget as the brief. Measured, two
    summary calls at the turn's effort returned an empty body having spent
    the whole budget before the brief began, and compaction then degraded
    to blind elision for the rest of the run.

    The ceiling is ``SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS`` bounded by the model's own and by
    what is left of the window once the request is built, so raising the
    budget can neither turn a summary into a request a small model refuses
