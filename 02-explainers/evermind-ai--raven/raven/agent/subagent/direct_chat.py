"""One direct chat's on-disk record, and the handoff it owes the main agent.

A direct-chat turn is deliberately absent from the session transcript (the
whole point is to keep those exchanges out of the main agent's context), so
this directory is the only evidence it happened:

    <session_dir>/subagents/direct/<agent>/<handle>/
    |-- messages.json         resume state (raven/agent/subagent/instance_state.py)
    `-- <call_id>/            one turn: prompt.md, out.md, meta.json

A directory per turn, which the delegation surfaces no longer keep: their
artifacts are flat under ``nodes/``, keyed by an id the model chose. A direct
chat has no such id -- nobody names a turn to reference it later -- so the
minted ``call_id`` still does the addressing here, and ``make_call_id`` exists
for this tree alone.

A file name is never derived from a sub-agent's output, only from ids raven
mints itself -- the same invariant ``raven/agent/subagent/history.py`` states.
The handoff block relies on it: the block is prepended to user text, and it is
safe to leave unwrapped only because every byte in it is raven's own.
