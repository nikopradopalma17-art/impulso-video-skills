"""Read a run back with live state overlaid, for a client that missed the events.

The ``dag_*`` progress events are not replayed anywhere, so a client that was not
listening for all of them -- a reloaded browser tab, a TUI whose gateway
restarted mid-run -- can only rebuild the graph from disk. An unfinalized run has
no ``manifest.json``, so every node reads back ``pending``; the instance registry
rows are the only durable record of how far it actually got.

Shared by both RPC surfaces so a resumed graph cannot mean two different things
depending on which client asked.

    Args:
        tool (`SubAgentDagTool`):
            The live tool, read for the run dir. Its own ``active_run_ids`` is
            the fallback for liveness, and a narrow one: ``_cancels`` is
            per-instance, so the registered tool answers ``False`` for a run the
            playbook engine's private tool owns, and every unfinished node of it
            gets overlaid ``interrupted``.
        live_runs (`Callable[[], set[str]] | None`):
            Liveness across *every* graph tool, which is what a caller holding
            the agent loop can supply (``subagent.dag_live.live_run_ids``). The
            fourth consumer of this question and the one that was missed: the two
            ``subagents.*`` readers and the web cancel were routed through the
            loop, this one kept reading the tool, so a backgrounded playbook run
            reopened from history came back with every running node marked
            interrupted.
        run_id (`str`):
            The run to read.
        session_key (`str | None`):
            Names the session whose working directory holds the run dir, and
            scopes the registry rows consulted for the overlay.

    Returns:
        `dict`:
            The manifest-shaped payload from :func:`dag_reader.read_run`, with
            per-node status/timestamps and the summary recomputed from the
            overlay when the run had not finalized.
