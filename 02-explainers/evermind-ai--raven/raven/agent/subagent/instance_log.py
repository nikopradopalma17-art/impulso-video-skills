"""One sub-agent instance's own conversation, kept for the whole conversation.

A call record answers "what was this one dispatch", and an instance outlives it:
a stateful agent resumed under the same handle spans many calls, and those calls
arrive through three different lanes -- ``spawn``, a DAG node, and a direct chat
-- each of which writes its own record directory. So an instance's conversation
was only ever readable by walking three directory shapes and stitching them
together in the right order, which nothing did.

This module gives an instance one home per conversation, beside the rest of that
conversation's sub-agent history:

``<session_dir>/subagents/instances/<agent>/<handle>.jsonl``
    The instance's conversation, in the *same format* as the session log at
    ``sessions/<group>/<chat_id>.jsonl`` -- a ``_type: "metadata"`` header, then
    untagged message rows. Anything that can read a raven session can read a
    sub-agent instance's session.

The wire frames behind those turns are deliberately *not* copied here. They are
already written, in full and in order, by :mod:`raven.acp_client.journal`, and a
per-instance copy was measured to hold no record the journal did not: 47 records
against 47, for 78x the transcript's bytes. What such a copy would have added is
reach -- the journal lives in the audit store, outside any workspace a sub-agent
can read -- and nothing asks for that today. A call's record still names the
journal and the byte range it occupied, so the frames remain findable.

Local file I/O rather than the DAG core's file backend, even on the DAG lane:
this is a session-level artifact outside any run directory, written the way
``SpawnRecord`` and ``DirectChatRecord`` beside it already write, and the only
backend that exists is the local one.

Nothing here may fail a run. Every write is best-effort and every failure is a
log line.
