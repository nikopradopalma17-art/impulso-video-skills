"""Live-run questions about a graph, asked of a whole agent loop.

Two graph tools exist by design: the one on the model's tool table, and the
playbook engine's private one (a ``mode: dag`` playbook is dispatched by the
engine, not by the model). ``AgentLoop.dag_tools`` is what puts them behind one
accessor, and the consumers that ask a live-run question go through here rather
than each carrying its own copy of the same fallback: the two ``subagents.*``
instance readers, the web RPC's cancel, and ``read_run_reconciled`` on both
surfaces that read a run back. That last one was missed on the first pass -- it
took liveness off the tool it was handed, which is the registered instance, so a
backgrounded playbook run reopened from history came back with every unfinished
node overlaid ``interrupted``. No count is stated here: a number in a docstring
goes stale the moment a fifth caller appears, and this one did.

They arrive as a duck-typed ``loop`` because the RPC layers hold whatever the
factory gave them, including a test double with no such method. Both answers are
advisory: what they decide is whether a row draws as running and whether a stop
button reports anything, so a loop that cannot answer must degrade rather than
raise -- these are invoked lazily, only for a row that still reads running, so
an exception here would surface from a branch most callers never reach.
