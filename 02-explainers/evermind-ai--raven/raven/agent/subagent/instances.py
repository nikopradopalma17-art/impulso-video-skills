Maps ``(session_key, agent, handle)`` to the CLI's own session id so a later
spawn with the same handle resumes instead of starting fresh. Stored as a list

A record's lifetime is its chat session's: there is no time-based expiry, and

    A handle maps to a single session inside the CLI's own store; two runs
    resuming it at once interleave that session's transcript or corrupt it.
    Process-wide and keyed by the handle rather than held on a backend object,
    because the DAG tool and the sub-agent manager build *separate* backends
    from the same config -- a per-backend lock would let a spawn and a DAG node
    resume the same session side by side.

    The refcount is taken before the lock is awaited, so a waiter keeps the
    entry alive and the map never strands a lock two callers disagree about.

    Re-entrant within one task, and it has to be: the direct-chat path takes
    this around a whole turn, and the cli backend takes it again around its own
    lookup-run-commit sequence. Both are right to -- each is the outermost hold
    on some other path -- and the two together are still one resumption, which
    is what the lock protects. Non-reentrant, that pair is a deadlock with no
    error and no timeout: the turn's record simply stays ``running`` forever.
