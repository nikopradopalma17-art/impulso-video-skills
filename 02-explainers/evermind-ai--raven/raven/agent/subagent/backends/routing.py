"""One product entry fronting several implementations: the route is picked on ``run``.

A row declaring ``routes`` is the only row the dispatching model sees for the
work its targets do (they ship ``hidden``). Every caller that dispatches to the
row -- ``spawn``, a DAG node and its retries, a WebUI direct chat -- resolves
one backend by name and calls ``run`` on it, so this is the one seat where the
task text and the implementation meet, and the gate lives here rather than once
per caller.

``run`` reads the task as the dispatching model wrote it (``authored_task``;
the rendered ``task`` only where a caller has no other text): a lane may have
inlined whole files into the rendered task, and their contents are neither
routing evidence nor something to send through the host model again. It picks
in this order:

1. a reused ``instance`` handle continues the conversation it was opened on --
   the implementation whose transport already bound the handle in this
   session wins, and nothing is classified;
2. otherwise the host's classifier (set by the manager, which holds the host
   model) picks between the targets and this row's own implementation, reading
   the targets' roster lines only: the fronting row's line is written for the
   dispatching model and argues the opposite case;
3. no classifier, no answer, or an answer outside the set keeps the task on the
   row's own implementation -- a route can redirect, never lose, a task.

Step 2's answer is read twice. It says which implementation the work is for,
and it is also the only thing on this seat that knows *what kind of work it
is*: the classifier answering a target is the entry learning that this task is
the target's specialty. ``_target_open`` then decides whether that specialty's
own lane may run here -- whether the deployment holds the credentials the
target's pipeline spends, whether the dispatch hands over the file the target
builds on, and the tier this dispatch runs at. When it may not, the task stays on the
row's own implementation and carries the closed route's own note with it, so the
lane that ends up building it is told what the other lane would have produced,
and how to produce it here.

That note is declared per route and never written in this module. The gate is
one piece of code serving every row that declares a route, and the only row
declaring one today fronts a deck engine: a sentence about decks compiled into
the gate would be appended, the day a second row routes, to requests that are
not decks. A route declaring no note hands the task over exactly as it arrived.

The wrapper is the row's backend as far as the host is concerned: binders and
config pushes are forwarded to every implementation (a target's own row is on
the table but nothing addresses it, so it would otherwise never be bound), and
every other attribute reads off the row's own implementation.
