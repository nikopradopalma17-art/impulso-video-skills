"""The rows one delegated turn contributes to an instance's conversation.

Owns the row shape and nothing else: an ordered event list in, provider-shaped
message rows out. Two transports produce that list -- the ACP collector reading
`session/update` notifications, and the OpenAI Step Dialect reading a response
field -- and one implementation of the shape is what makes an `openai`
instance's conversation read identically to an `acp` one.

Deliberately ignorant of both. A `call` event carries a tool name and a JSON
string, never an `acp_dialects.ToolCall`: a shared builder that imported one
transport's vocabulary would not be shared.

The final answer is not a row here. The record keeps it and the reader appends
it as the Closing Message; `in_flight_answer` is for a live read, which has no
record to append it from.
