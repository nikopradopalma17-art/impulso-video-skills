def agent_meta(cfg: Any, *, snapshot: Any = None) -> AgentMeta:
    """The advertised capabilities of one agent config, any kind.

    "Stateful" means reusing an instance handle continues that agent's
    conversation instead of starting a fresh one, and it is always read from the
    mechanism that would have to deliver it -- never from a wish:

    - ``builtin``: always true. The mechanism is raven's own replay of the stored
      message list (``instance_state.py``), which it owns end to end for an
      in-process loop, so there is no endpoint-specific exception to make. Its
      other two capabilities are likewise structural: the loop runs here, so it
      reads this filesystem, and it reports usage and tool calls as it works
      (``raven_loop.py``), which is what ``live_progress`` advertises.
    - ``cli``: from ``resume_command``. The schema already forces the optional
      ``stateful`` field to agree with it.
    - ``acp``: from the agent's own ``loadSession``, recorded in a capability
      snapshot at registration. Resuming an acp instance is that agent's
      ``session/load``, so the capability that method is gated on is the one
      that answers whether reusing a handle continues the session -- not
      ``sessionCapabilities.resume``, which the three agents measured on
      2026-09-07 report false while resuming correctly. An acp config has no
      ``resume_command`` at all, so falling through to the cli rule would report
      every acp agent stateless -- which would strip the ``instance`` parameter
      out of the spawn schema entirely and make the DAG pre-check reject any
      graph that shares a handle.
    - ``openai``: from the config's ``stateful`` field, which defaults to true.
      The delivering mechanism here is raven's own replay of the stored message
      list (``raven/agent/subagent/instance_state.py``), which works against
      every endpoint -- so the mechanism cannot be what distinguishes them, and
      defaulting off would report a capability absent that is in fact present.
      What differs is whether a given endpoint is *meaningful* under replay, and
      that is a fact about the endpoint no probe can reach: mirothinker, for
      one, ignores a system prompt entirely, so replaying a transcript at it
      continues nothing. A false is therefore an endpoint-specific exception a
      preset states, or the operator of a custom endpoint writes by hand; the
      declaration is the only available carrier of a fact raven cannot discover.

    ``snapshot`` is the already-loaded snapshot for this config, for callers
    handling a batch. Omitted, it is read from the store -- so a caller that
    knows nothing about ACP (the spawn manager, the DAG tool) needs no change.

    Defined once here because three callers derive it -- the spawn manager, the
    DAG tool's roster, and the DAG capability pre-check -- and a split definition
    would let them disagree.
