"""The environment a spawned CLI subagent runs under.

A third-party CLI agent is a program the user also runs from their own terminal,
so it should see that terminal's environment rather than raven's. Raven's own
process environment carries its launcher's PATH ordering and whatever the editor
injected, which is enough to make a child resolve the wrong interpreter: raven's
PATH can list a conda bin ahead of /usr/local/bin, and openclaw hard-exits on an
unsupported node with no way to override the check. The capture runs the user's
own login shell from a minimal base (not raven's environment) so both leaks
close: the profile's PATH wins, and an editor-injected variable like
CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT is actually absent rather than merely overlaid.

*Which* shell is `$SHELL`, not a hardcoded one, and that choice is load-bearing.
Running `bash` on a host whose login shell is zsh walks `~/.bash_profile` and
never reads the `~/.zshrc` where that user's PATH additions live -- yet `bash`
exists, `env -0` prints, and the exit status is 0, so the capture is not treated
as a failure and the fallbacks below never fire. The result is a PATH that
resolves nothing the user installed, which reads downstream as "agent not
installed" for agents that work fine in their terminal.

Only shells this module knows how to drive are driven: `bash` and `zsh` both
read profile-then-rc under `-lic`. For anything else -- fish, which prints a
greeting under `-i` that would corrupt the first parsed variable, or an unset
`$SHELL` -- raven's own environment is returned instead. Substituting a shell
the user does not use would produce a confidently wrong PATH; falling back is
merely no better than not capturing at all.

The shell is both login (`-l`) and interactive (`-i`), and neither flag alone
is enough. `-l` is what walks the profile chain (`/etc/profile`,
`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.profile`) where installers for bun, nvm,
and cargo write their PATH exports; `-ic` alone skips that chain entirely and
only reads `/etc/bash.bashrc` and `~/.bashrc`. `-i` is needed on top because
most distro `~/.bashrc` files open with a `[ -z "$PS1" ] && return` guard that a
non-interactive shell never gets past, so anything placed below it -- proxy
settings, nvm/conda init -- never runs either. Only `-lic` together runs the
same profile + rc chain the user's own terminal does.

Known limitation: if the login shell's profile prints a banner to stdout, that
banner corrupts the first parsed variable. This is not worked around here.
