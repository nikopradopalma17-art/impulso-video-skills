"""Third-party OpenAI-compatible HTTP agent backend (mirothinker, …) as a
spawned sub-agent.

Each call is one Chat Completions request. A resumed instance replays its
prior ``history`` as the leading messages instead of the endpoint holding any
session state itself; see ``run``'s ``history``/``on_messages`` pair. The API
key lives in config; the raw JSON is read directly so provider extension
fields survive. ``reasoning_steps`` is one of those: it is how a deep-research
endpoint reports the work behind an answer, and it reaches the run's own record
through :mod:`raven.agent.subagent.openai_steps`.
