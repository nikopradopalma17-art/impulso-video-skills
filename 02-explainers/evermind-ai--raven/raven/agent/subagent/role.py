"""Whether this process is serving as someone else's sub-agent, and what it gives up.

``RavenLoopBackend`` narrows an in-process sub-agent by construction: it registers
into an empty ``ToolRegistry`` and never adds the orchestration tools, so a
sub-agent cannot delegate the task it was handed. A ``kind: acp`` agent whose
command is ``raven acp`` gets none of that narrowing -- the child is a separate
raven process that builds its own full registry from its own config and has no way
to tell a DAG node from a user. Measured on a graph whose first node ran the
built-in ``Raven`` agent over acp: the child answered by handing the node's whole
task to a background ``spawn``, whose receipt returns before any work is done, and
ended the turn on the receipt. Twice, with a continuation in between.

The signal is an environment variable rather than a flag on the command line
because ``command`` is user-authored config: a flag would need every existing
install edited by hand and would fail silently wherever one was missed. The host
already injects ``RAVEN_HOME`` into every child it launches, so this rides a
channel that exists.

Third of three mechanisms for one rule, and the division between them is scope
rather than preference. ``RavenLoopBackend`` narrows the registry it builds, which
reaches only what it builds. ``IN_SUBAGENT_RUN``
(:mod:`raven.agent.subagent.backends.base`) is a ``ContextVar`` that
``run_subagent_dag`` refuses on, which reaches any code running inside that
backend's task -- and a ``ContextVar`` does not cross a process boundary, so it
cannot reach a child at all. This one is what the child reads about itself, and
it is the only one of the three that survives the fork/exec.

# The variable, its reader and its writer live in ``raven.home``, the one module
# every shelf may import: ``raven.ops`` reads the role to pick whose machine list
# is authoritative, and ops importing raven.agent would tie the two packages into
# a cycle. Re-exported here so the sub-agent code keeps its own address for them.
from raven.home import SUBAGENT_ENV_VAR, is_subagent_process, subagent_role_env

#: Every tool that dispatches work to another agent, or steers a dispatch already
#: running. Withheld from a sub-agent because a node's whole point is that *this*
#: agent does the work; a sub-agent that delegates returns a receipt, and the
#: caller cannot tell that from an answer.
#:
#: ``load_playbook`` is here for a reason its name hides: a ``dag`` playbook
#: dispatches from inside the call, so it is a third route to a graph next to
#: ``spawn`` and ``run_subagent_dag``. The three ``*_dag`` controls only steer a
#: run this process started, and already report "no run_subagent_dag tool is
#: registered" when asked without one -- they are dropped so the model is not
#: offered three tools that can only answer that.
#:
#: ``a2a_send`` is here because it reaches another agent without passing through
#: ``spawn`` -- the same shape as ``load_playbook``. A sub-agent that hands its
#: task to an external A2A peer returns a receipt, and the caller cannot tell
#: that from an answer.
#:
#: ``message`` is deliberately absent. The in-process backend withholds it, but an
#: acp child reaches its caller over the protocol rather than through that tool.
#:
#: Read by the tests rather than by the gates. Neither gate can filter a name list:
#: both work by not building the thing at all -- one skips a block of
#: registrations, the other leaves the playbook funnel unbuilt so its two tools
#: decline their binding -- and a filter applied after construction would pay for
#: the tools it then discards. So this is the specification, and
#: ``tests/test_agent_loop_subagent_role.py`` is what holds the two gates to it,
#: in both directions: a name here that nothing registers fails as loudly as a
#: name the gates let through.
