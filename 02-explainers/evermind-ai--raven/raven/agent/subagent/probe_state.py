"""Remembered outcomes of explicit subagent availability probes.

Worth keeping, because for a cli agent the free probe can only answer
"installed" while the failures that matter -- a missing provider credential, a
hard runtime-version gate -- are observable only by running the thing.

Worth invalidating, because a remembered verdict becomes a lie the moment the
configuration it measured changes. Every record therefore carries a digest of the
fields that decide how the agent runs, and a verdict whose digest no longer
matches is treated as absent rather than shown as current. Doing it by digest
rather than by hooking the write path is what also covers a hand-edited
``config.json``, an edit no UI hook would ever see.

    """What the reader has to do before an agent can answer, as data a page can draw.

    The verdict `probe._refusal_detail` spells out in English for the log, the
    CLI and the TUI, in a form a page can put in its reader's language: which
    kind of fix, and the command that makes it on this machine when one is
    known. The English sentence stays the record; this is the same decision,
    not a second one -- both are made from the one classification, so a page
    and a terminal cannot disagree about what a refusal needs.

    ``sign_in`` and ``setup`` are fixed outside the page, in a terminal;
    ``api_key`` is fixed in the page, since the row is an endpoint and a key.
    ``download`` is ``npx`` failing to fetch the agent (`npx_fetch_failure`):
    fixed in the network, the npm registry or the proxy, with the preset's own
    command as the way to fetch it in a terminal, where nothing times it out --
    and no command at all for a row whose command was edited, since that is
    its operator's execution config (`probe._shipped_command`).

    The rest are the agent's model provider answering and refusing, as the agent
    relayed the provider's own HTTP status: ``model`` (404, the model it is set
    to use is not served -- gone from a free tier, or not found), ``billing``
    (402, no credit), ``quota`` (429, rate-limited or a daily quota spent), and
    ``network`` (the provider could not be reached at all). ``silent`` is the
    one without a reason: the agent kept working past the connect's wait and
    said nothing, and ``command`` is what makes it say why. ``upgrade`` is an
    agent too old to know its own ACP flag; ``exited`` is one that quit and
    left its reason on stderr, which the English detail already carries.

    Two are about the agent's own account rather than a provider's answer:
    ``plan`` is an account signed in whose plan does not include the agent, with
    the page that sells one as ``command``, and ``config`` is an agent that
    cannot read its own config file, with the command that says where it is
    wrong.

    ``then`` is what to type once ``command`` is running, for an agent whose fix
    is a step inside it rather than the command itself (`presets.SignIn.then`).

    ``runtime`` is an agent that quit on start because the Node.js it was
    launched with is older than its package declares: ``needs`` is that floor
    and ``found`` the version launched, both measured, and ``command`` the
    upgrade when the Node.js's installer is recognisable
    (`node_runtime.node_too_old`).
