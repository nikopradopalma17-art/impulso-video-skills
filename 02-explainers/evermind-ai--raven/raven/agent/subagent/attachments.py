"""How a turn's attachments travel to a sub-agent.

A sub-agent never receives bytes: the host already holds every attachment as a
file, so what crosses is a path the agent's own tools can open. Two spellings,
one per transport. An ACP agent takes ``resource_link`` blocks beside the text,
the block an editor sends for an @-mentioned file, which the agent renders as a
line naming the path; a text-only transport (an in-process loop, an OpenAI-style
endpoint, a CLI) gets the same facts appended to the task as a note.

Absolute paths on purpose. A direct chat's text carries the page's own note with
a path relative to the *host's* agent home (``uploads/x.pptx``), which resolves to
nothing from the sub-agent's working directory: a deck agent handed that spelling
reported the file as not there and fell back to a bundled template. Handed the
absolute path beside it, the same agent still tried the note's spelling first, so
the note is rewritten too: each of its bullets that names an attachment relative
to the host's home is replaced by the absolute path (``retarget_note``), and a
link is named by that same relative spelling so the two are visibly one file.
