"""Model-facing controls for an in-flight ``run_subagent_dag`` run.

``cancel_dag`` stops a run the model already submitted; ``dag_status`` reports
one run's live per-node progress, or lists the runs in flight; ``resolve_dag_node``
answers a node suspended on an exception verdict. All three are kept out of the
provider's tool schema on purpose (``ToolRegistry.hide_from_schema``): the only
place that tells the model these exist is ``run_subagent_dag``'s own acceptance
text -- and, for ``resolve_dag_node``, the exception report -- so the per-turn
tool list carries nothing a conversation that never starts a DAG has any use
for. The model reaches them by naming them through ``tool_call``, which is
registered whether or not progressive disclosure is on for exactly this reason;
the registry resolves either way, as its dispatch never consults the schema.
