"""Loading a charter's own judge, and the gate it has to pass to run.

A declarative rule says "this argument must start with that". Some judgements
cannot be said that way -- parse this argument, count these calls, compare two
of them -- and for those a charter may carry Python. This is what decides
whether that Python is allowed to run, and what runs it.

Two things make the decision tractable here rather than frightening:

- **Where it runs.** Inside the worker's own process, on the worker's own
  calls. That process is already an agent holding ``exec``; a judge loaded into
  it holds no authority the agent did not already have, and a judge that
  misbehaves costs one dispatch rather than the conversation that asked for it.
- **What it may be.** Not arbitrary Python: an allow-listed subset, checked on
  the parse tree before anything is compiled. No imports, no loops, no dunder
  access, no calls except a named handful. A judgement about one call needs
  none of what is refused.

The loop ban is the one worth naming. Nothing here can stop a judge from taking
forever once it is running -- the dispatch it belongs to has no deadline by
default, and that is deliberate, because a long job is a long job. Refusing
``while`` and ``for`` at the gate is what makes running forever impossible to
reach rather than merely unlikely.
