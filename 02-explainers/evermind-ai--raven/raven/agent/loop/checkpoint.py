"""Per-turn shadow-git checkpoint of the workspace (a recovery safety net).

Commits the workspace to an out-of-band git repo (separate ``--git-dir``,
work-tree pointed at the real workspace) at the end of each turn. The user's
own ``.git`` is never touched. A truncated multi-file edit therefore leaves a
recoverable snapshot, and the interrupted turn's changed files can be listed
for the next turn's recovery prompt.

Scope (documented limits):
- Only filesystem state is snapshotted — not conversation state.
- Changes made via shell tools (``rm``/``mv``/``sed -i``) are captured by the
  next ``add -A`` but are not attributable to a specific tool call. This is an
  *undo stack for the working tree*, not full crash recovery.
- Granularity is per-turn (one commit per turn), matching Claude Code/Cursor.

Safety layers (defense in depth against snapshotting things the user doesn't
want stored):
1. ``info/exclude`` ships an expanded default blacklist covering common build
   artifacts, virtualenvs, IDE state, OS junk, and likely-credential paths.
2. The work-tree's own ``.gitignore`` files are honored automatically by git
   (standard ``add -A`` semantics) — so anything the user marked private in
   their own repo stays out of the shadow as well.
3. ``gc.auto`` is configured so a periodic ``git gc --auto`` keeps long-lived
   sessions from accumulating loose objects forever.

Every git invocation is best-effort: failures are logged and degrade to a
no-op (return ``None``) so the checkpoint layer can never break a turn.
