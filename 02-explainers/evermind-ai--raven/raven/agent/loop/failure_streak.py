"""When a repeated tool failure is a stuck loop, and what to say about it.

The agent loop injects a change-approach nudge after the same tool fails the
same way several turns running. Two judgements decide whether that helps: which
failures are deterministic enough to count at all (a 429 clears itself), and
what counts as "the same failure" (two different errors mean the model is still
adapting). Both live here rather than in the loop, which only does the counting.

def failure_class(model_text: str) -> str:
    """Which kind of failure this is, for streak accounting.

    Coarse on purpose: the streak asks "is the model repeating the same dead
    call", and two different errors from one tool mean it is still adapting.
    Counting them together fires the nudge at a model that is working through
    a problem, which is the opposite of what the nudge is for.

    A JSON envelope is classified by its own ``error`` string rather than by the
    ladder below, which cannot see into one: the whole payload starts with ``{`` and
    spells the key ``"error":``, so every envelope failure falls through to ``other``
    and a blocked URL, a spent key and a reader's HTTP status all become one streak.
    Two of those in a row would fire the nudge at a model that changed both its cause
    and its approach, which is the case this function exists to keep apart.

    The envelope class is the error text itself, not a bucket, and that is the one
    place coarseness buys nothing. Coarseness is for model-facing prose, which varies
    without meaning anything; an envelope's ``error`` is written by the tool from a
    small fixed vocabulary, so equal strings really are the same failure and different
    ones really are different.

    That vocabulary is a convention its producers keep, not something this module can
    enforce: nothing here can stop a tool interpolating an exception into ``error``,
    and a writer that does splits one repeated cause into a class per host, so the
    streak never reaches the nudge. The variable parts a page brings with it -- the
    URL, the host, the exception's own text -- therefore belong in the envelope's other
    keys, and this one carries only what a reader could enumerate. The failure mode is
    the mirror of the one above: there, distinct causes counted as one; here, one cause
    counts as many.
