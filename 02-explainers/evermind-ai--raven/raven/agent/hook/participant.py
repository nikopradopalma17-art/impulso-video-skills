"""The adapter that lets a participant sit in the hook chain: one turn, one instance.

``ParticipantHook`` is an ``AgentHook`` the composite runs like any other. Each
phase builds a ``StepView`` from the hook context, asks the participant the verbs
that belong to that phase, and renders the answers as a ``HookDecision`` --
so the loop's timing, the composite's merge rules and the rollback budget are
untouched, and the participant never sees the context.

A new participant is made from the factory the first time a turn's context is
seen: the loop builds one ``AgentHookContext`` per turn and mutates it across
iterations, so the context's identity is the turn's. ``before_user_inbound``
also starts a fresh one, since it is the turn's first phase whenever it runs
(sub-agent and sentinel turns skip it, which is why identity is the rule and
this is only the tidy case).
