"""Whether this process may serve A2A at all.

The second of the two gates the boundary needs. The outbound half rides the tool
registry -- ``a2a_send`` is simply not built in a sub-agent -- but serving a port
does not pass through the registry, so this is its own check.

The signal is ``RAVEN_SUBAGENT``, which the host merges into every ``kind: acp``
child it launches. All five products under ``agents/`` are ``kind: acp`` and none
overrides it, so the seam covers them and covers a future product for free.

    The assembly lives here, not at the call site, so the rpc surface imports this one
    module and nothing else out of ``raven/a2a/``. CONTEXT.md's surfaces law forbids a
    served surface from reaching into a sibling surface's insides, and the repo's answer
    for a legitimate hosting edge is a facade plus a roster guard -- the way ``raven/acp/``
    reaches rpc only through ``raven.rpc.bootstrap``.

    The handler is bound to a factory that re-resolves the loop per call rather than to a
    loop: at gateway-boot time the loop may not exist yet, and a later hot-reload swaps it
    in place. Building it behind `may_mount` keeps a2a-sdk off the module import path, so a
    gateway whose operator switched the face off never pays for it at all.

    An onboarded install does serve A2A, and that import is not free: measured at roughly
    570 ms and 391 modules on top of the gateway's own stack, sqlalchemy and the
    OpenTelemetry api among them. It is paid once at mount, not per request. Moving it to
    the first request instead is the way to take it back, and is recorded as deferred in
    the design note rather than done here.
