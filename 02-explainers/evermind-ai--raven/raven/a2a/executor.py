"""An A2A task becomes one raven turn.

The two methods the SDK asks for. Everything else about the protocol -- the
task store, the event queue, the eleven request-handler methods -- is
``DefaultRequestHandler``'s.

The failure path is a trust boundary: a turn's exception can carry file paths,
prompt fragments, tool output and credentials, and the A2A caller is in another
trust domain. So a raised turn puts a fixed sentence on the wire and the real
cause in this host's log -- never the traceback, never the exception's own
message.

A turn that asks a question does not suspend either: ``self._turn_runner(...)``
stays a live coroutine awaiting a future inside its task's ``A2aQuestionBroker``,
while the SDK's own producer/consumer split already runs ``execute`` in the
background and lets ``on_message_send`` return as soon as it sees the resulting
``INPUT_REQUIRED`` status. A later ``SendMessage`` against the same task id
resolves that future through ``answer`` instead of starting a second turn.
