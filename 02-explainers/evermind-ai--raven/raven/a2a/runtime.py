"""Assembling the inbound face: executor, request handler, and a standalone site.

The SDK's ``DefaultRequestHandler`` implements all eleven protocol methods over a
task store and an event queue; the only thing it lacks is what a turn is, which
is ``RavenAgentExecutor``. This module is where those two meet, so no other file
has to know how the SDK is put together.

``DefaultRequestHandler`` speaks protobuf request types; ``routes_aiohttp``
speaks plain JSON-RPC ``params`` dicts, which a real ``DefaultRequestHandler``
rejects. ``_RequestHandlerAdapter`` below is the seam between the two: it
presents the same six generic method names ``routes_aiohttp`` calls, and it is
where dict-to-protobuf conversion happens, exactly once per method, so
``routes_aiohttp`` itself never has to know the SDK's proto types exist.

The context both speak is the SDK's own ``ServerCallContext``. What
``routes_aiohttp`` puts in its ``state`` is per-request fact the process cannot
know -- see ``CALL_BASE_URL`` -- so a method that needs one reads it off the
call. A direct call may still pass ``None``; every method either ignores the
context or falls back, and none dereferences it.

    non-interactive, system-origin turn that wants one reply back rather than a
    token stream. `raven agent -m`'s own path (`raven/cli/agent_commands.py`)
    goes through `build_one_shot_spine` / `Scheduler.submit` / a `DeliveryHub`
    instead, but that path is for an interactive `Origin.USER` turn a person is
    watching; an inbound A2A call has no such watcher, so it does not need that
    machinery any more than a cron fan-out does.

    `Origin.HEARTBEAT`: an A2A call is not `CRON` (no cron job id, no per-session
    read-back table to write into), not `SUBAGENT` (no delegation chain, no
    parent conversation, and that origin gates personalization and skips hooks
    in ways that assume a sub-agent relay), and not `SENTINEL` (skips hooks and

    proactive, system-origin turn a peer agent asked for, which is exactly what
    `HEARTBEAT` already means elsewhere (`raven/cli/gateway_commands.py`'s
    `on_heartbeat_execute`). `HEARTBEAT`'s only special case is scheduler lane
    pooling, irrelevant here since this path never reaches the Scheduler.

    `conversation_id` is minted by the caller (`RavenAgentExecutor.execute`), not
    here: an A2A `SendMessage` carries no conversation of its own (unlike a
    TUI/gateway turn, which reuses one across a chat), and the executor needs the
    value before this coroutine ever returns it, to translate a later `answer(task_id, ...)`
    into the conversation id `broker` actually parks futures under.

    `broker` is installed onto the loop's `ask_user` tool only when given: see
    `make_run_turn_from_factory` for why the gateway-mounted path always passes
    `None` here instead of forwarding its caller's broker.

    No defensive try/except here: `RavenAgentExecutor.execute` (raven/a2a/executor.py)
