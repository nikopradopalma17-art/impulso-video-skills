"""The A2A JSON-RPC binding, on aiohttp.

Written to be deleted. The SDK ships ``add_a2a_routes_to_fastapi()``,
``create_jsonrpc_routes()`` and ``create_agent_card_routes()`` for an ASGI host;
this file exists only because the gateway is aiohttp. If that ever changes, drop
this module and call those -- no A2A logic moves with it.

Two orderings are load-bearing: the version header is checked before the method
is dispatched, and authentication is checked before anything reaches the
request handler, so an unknown caller never starts a turn.
