    """Wraps a channel as an Outlet: renders Text / MediaOut by calling
    ``channel.send(...)``, eats the streaming / in-turn events
    (StreamDelta / Reasoning / ToolEvent / Notice) — a channel is non-streaming
    and shows only the final reply (edit-in-place streaming is not yet supported).
    The one notice a channel does render is ``ORGAN_DEGRADED``: an answer
    produced without an organ says so, as its own short line, or the user reads
    a confident reply that never saw their memory. A real send failure raises,
    which the hub retries; eating is not failure.

    The deliverable carries its target as ``source`` (the hub routes here by
    source.channel, so it is always set); the reply goes back to that channel /
    chat. reply_to threading belongs to the inbound side and is not handled here."""
