"""Route a runtime-submitted turn to the spine that owns its conversation.

The gateway hosting the page runs two spines over one engine: its own, whose
hub delivers to the IM channels, and the page's (``build_rpc_stack``), whose
lanes carry the browser's turns. A turn the runtime submits on a conversation's
behalf -- a sub-agent's result relay -- used to go to the gateway spine
whatever the conversation, so a relay into a page session ran on a lane of its
own while the page's next turn ran on the page spine's lane for the same
session: two turns in one conversation at once, the session written from both
sides, and ``turn.send``'s one-turn-per-session guard seeing neither
(2026-09-08, the same tool calls drawn twice and the result delivered twice).

Routing by conversation key, the way ``RoutingQuestionBroker`` routes questions:
a page session is ``tui:<chat_id>``, everything else is a channel's. The key is
the scheduler's own (``raven.spine.conversation_id``), so the router and the
lane it routes onto cannot read one request two ways. The lane then serialises
the relay behind whatever the page is running for that session.
