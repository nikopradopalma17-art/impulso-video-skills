"""Ask the running gateway what a channel is actually doing.

A channel adapter is a live object owned by the ``raven gateway`` process, so
no other process can read it. Every other surface therefore reported the config
file's ``enabled`` flag as if it were a connection: written true, drawn
"connected", whether or not a single message could pass.

This is the thin client that closes that gap. It finds the gateway the same way
``doctor`` does -- the lock payload, which now carries the endpoint and a
per-boot token -- and asks it. Deliberately small: one request per call, no
subscriptions, no reconnect ladder. Every failure answers ``None``, which the
caller renders as "unknown", never as "disconnected": a probe that cannot reach
the gateway knows less than nothing about the channels, and saying "not
connected" would be the same lie in a new place.

The answer is cached for a beat because the status poll is on a timer and the
underlying facts move on the order of seconds, not milliseconds.
