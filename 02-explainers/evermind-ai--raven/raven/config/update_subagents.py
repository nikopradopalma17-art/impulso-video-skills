"""Atomic write path for ``subagents.agents`` config.

The only supported write path for agent config. Every entry point (CLI, the
WebUI "configure Raven" page) must go through here. Entries are validated against
the schema (discriminated on ``kind``) before anything is written, and the write
is atomic (temp file + os.replace).

Written under the ``agents`` key; a config still holding the old ``thirdParty``
one is read and migrated on the next write, so the two never coexist.

The built-in rows are *not* written here. They are package seeds
(``raven.agent.subagent.builtin_agents``), and a caller may store an override row
for one -- but not change its ``kind``, and not remove it, since "absent" is what
"use the package's row" means. Both are refused below.

Redaction of secrets (``api_key``) is a display concern left to the caller — this
primitive round-trips raw values so a read→edit→write cycle never clobbers a key.

    ``tools``, ``model``). One redeclaration is supported: an ``acp`` entry
