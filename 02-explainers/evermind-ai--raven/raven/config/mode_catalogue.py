Inner by necessity rather than by taste. The agent loop needs the default tier
and the RPC surface serves the whole catalogue, and neither may reach through
``raven.acp`` to get it: the architecture contracts forbid an inner layer
knowing a surface at all, and name ``raven.rpc`` importing ``raven.acp``
specifically. What stays behind in :mod:`raven.acp.modes` is the part that is
genuinely the ACP surface's own -- which mode each live session is currently on.
