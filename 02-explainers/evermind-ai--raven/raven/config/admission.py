"""Config-slice admission: validate and apply declared defaults at dispensing.

Config-with-cargo: a manifest
may declare ``config_schema`` — a flat mapping of key -> {type, default?,
required?} — and the registry admits the user's slice against it right
before the factory sees it. An empty declaration keeps today's verbatim
pass-through, so every plugin that declares nothing is untouched.

Tolerance rules: a missing slice reads as ``{}``;
admission consults nothing outside the slice itself, so breakage elsewhere
in the config cannot take the plugin path down; failures name the plugin
and the key, because "which cargo refused to board and why" is the whole
point of failing loudly at the door instead of deep inside a turn.
