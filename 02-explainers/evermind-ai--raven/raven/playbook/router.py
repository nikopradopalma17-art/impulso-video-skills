"""Which playbooks this turn shows the model, when the library outgrows the prompt.

Above ``top_k`` the full description is rendered for the top-K only, while the
name enum stays the whole library: listing every playbook whole costs a
description plus a parameter table each, spent on every turn whether or not
anything is relevant.

The narrowing is the same shape as the skill side's
(:class:`~raven.memory_engine.skill_forge.SkillForgeRouter`): over-fetch, then cut
to ``top_k``, with the sizes in config. What is deliberately *not* copied is the
weighted cross-source RRF -- a playbook library has one source, so there is
nothing to fuse -- and the router instance itself: mixing playbooks into the skill
router would put them in competition for the same K slots and change which skills
a turn gets.

**Two costs, handled differently.** The `name` enum stays the *whole* library
(~5 tokens a name), because a recall miss must not become "the model cannot reach
it": the user can still name a playbook outright, and the tool's own error can
list every one. The expensive part -- description, parameter table, which fields
are blank -- is rendered for the top-K only, so it stays flat as the library grows.

    Trigger keywords are the author's own account of when their playbook applies,

    count matters because a message matching three of a playbook's words is a
    better fit than one matching a single generic word. The description is scanned
    too, at a lower weight, so a playbook whose vocabulary is thin is still
    reachable by what it says it does.

    The keyword half is counted by :class:`TriggerIndex`, which normalized the
    whole library's vocabulary once at load. Re-normalizing it here would repeat
    that for every keyword of every playbook on every turn -- two thousand calls a
    turn on a hundred-playbook library, to reach the answer the index already has.

    Deliberately not an embedding lookup: this runs on every turn, ahead of the
    model, and the same reasoning that kept the vocabulary scan free applies here.
    Retrieval failure is no longer a lost feature either -- it only costs a line in
    a tool description, and the enum still holds every name.
