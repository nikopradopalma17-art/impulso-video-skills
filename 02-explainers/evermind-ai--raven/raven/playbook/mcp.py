"""The MCP servers one playbook run may reach, and the pre-flight that opens them.

A playbook's ``mcps: [local-pg]`` is a bare local short name resolved against the
receiving machine's ``tools.mcpServers``, so a distributed playbook delivered
nothing unless that machine happened to have a server of that name. The spec's
own ``mcpServers`` section (:attr:`~raven.playbook.types.PlaybookSpec.mcp_servers`)
now travels with the file, and :func:`playbook_mcp_servers` fills its parameter
references in. **Precedence is realized at the MCP source, not in the grant
resolver**: playbook definitions on top, so the single ``source.server(name)``
lookup already answers playbook-first. A resolver branch would be a second
place for the same fact to be decided.

This pre-flight merges the two mappings into one before connecting, which the
conversational path deliberately does not (see ``LiveMcpSource``): here the
merged mapping is also what the manager dials, so every definition the source
can answer with is one this run connected, and a shadowed name has no host
connection left to be confused with.

And ``raven playbook run`` wired no MCP source at all, so every declared server
resolved to ``not_connected`` however well the machine was configured.
:func:`preflight_mcp_source` is what it wires: one short-lived
``MCPConnectionManager`` over a throwaway registry, connected once before the
graph starts.

The pre-flight is also where authorization happens, and it **must not wait on a
person**: a server whose OAuth flow parks on the browser is already marked
``auth_required`` by the manager's own oauth hook and detached from the sync (see
``MCPConnectionManager._attempt_or_detach``), so the connect that cannot finish
costs the run nothing and the server is simply not delivered -- with
``McpGrant.note_text()`` saying why. Nothing here may re-introduce a wait on it.

The connections stay open for the run rather than closing after the handshake:
an in-process (``raven-loop``) node is granted the host's *live* tool wrappers,
so closing the manager first would deliver nothing to it. A bridged sub-agent
opens its own upstream per dispatch and does not read them.
