"""Offline trigger expansion -- build a playbook's L1 match vocabulary.

Callers may expand a description, the user's original wording and author seeds
through an LLM, then pass the candidates through the same guards used for
model-generated and hand-written vocabularies:

- **rule filter** -- too-short entries and bare function words;
- **generic-word filter** -- when the caller supplies a representative negative
  corpus, candidates matching too many unrelated messages are removed.

Generic entries can crowd specific playbooks out of the top-K descriptions the
main model sees. They never dispatch work or cause a per-message LLM call.

Cross-playbook collision checking is a separate pure function over the
whole library (`find_collisions`), run at load/compile time by the caller.
