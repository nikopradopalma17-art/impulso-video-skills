"""The playbook vocabulary index — a retrieval hint, no longer a trigger.

``TriggerIndex`` normalizes a library's keywords once and substring-matches a
message against them. That is all this module does now.

The decision belongs where the context is. The model sees the playbooks in
``load_playbook``'s description and chooses, exactly as it chooses between
``spawn`` and ``run_subagent_dag``. Keywords still earn a playbook its place in
that description when the library is too big to list whole
(:mod:`raven.playbook.router`) -- they make it *visible*, they no longer make it
*run*.
