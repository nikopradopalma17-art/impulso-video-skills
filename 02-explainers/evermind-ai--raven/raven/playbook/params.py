"""Parameter values and parameter references, for one playbook.

Two halves of one contract live here: what a declared parameter resolves to at
run time, and where that value may be written into the file's own text. One
pattern, ``_PARAM_REF_RE``, is the only definition of a parameter reference, so
substitution and validation cannot disagree about what one looks like.

Two spellings mean the same thing: ``${params.X}`` and ``{{ params.X }}``. The
second exists because ``{{ ... }}`` is the file's other placeholder family (a
node's output), so an author reaching for it inside an MCP server definition is
not making a different request. Node-output placeholders are untouched by this
module: they are the runner's, and only ``params.`` is claimed here.
