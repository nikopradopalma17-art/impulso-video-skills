"""Write the worker table for the question that just arrived.

What the model is asked for is deliberately small. With no graph there are no
nodes to name, no edges to keep acyclic and no per-node agent assignment --
which is where a graph-shaped generator spends both its tokens and its failure
modes. What is left is: which of these agents does this question need, and what
is each one's brief.

The candidate lists are handed in rather than described. A roster the host
renders into the tool's own ``enum`` cannot be hallucinated, so "an agent that
does not exist" stops being a repair round and becomes a shape the request
could not express. Only the judgements that remain -- which agents, how many,
what brief -- can be wrong, and those are what a repair round can fix.

One repair round, then the turn runs unconfigured. A turn that dies because its
configuration step failed is strictly worse than a turn that runs without one.
