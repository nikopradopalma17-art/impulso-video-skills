"""Playbook — reusable task templates: generation, matching, execution.

Generation, discovery by the model, execution. A playbook is one directory
under the playbooks scan root holding a
``playbook.md`` (two-field frontmatter, human body, one fenced
``yaml playbook-spec`` block) — one file, no sidecar. The two modes differ
only in where the graph comes from: ``dag`` ships it, ``prompt`` ships
assembly guidance a model turns into a graph at run time — same validation,
same execution chain. Whether a playbook is offered on this machine is config
(``playbooks.disabled``), never file content.

Package layout:

- ``types``      — the pydantic contract (:class:`PlaybookSpec` et al.)
- ``agent_profiles`` — what each sub-agent on the table can be asked to do
- ``llm_result`` — the shapes a generation call comes back in
- ``params``     — parameter values and ``${params.x}`` / ``{{ params.x }}`` refs
- ``mcp``        — the servers a run may reach, and the MCP pre-flight
- ``triggers``   — offline vocabulary expansion + guards (L1 material)
- ``matcher``    — the trigger vocabulary index (a retrieval hint)
- ``router``     — which playbooks this turn describes in full
- ``validate``   — the field definition's rule table
- ``prompt``     — generation / repair / revise / compose prompt assembly
- ``store``      — playbook.md persistence
- ``generator``  — :class:`PlaybookGenerator` (generate / revise)
- ``executor``   — matched spec + params -> a running graph
- ``runtime``    — the library plus ``load``, the one execution entry
