"""Hermes Agent scanner -- memory files and conversations.

Conversation listing drives the ``hermes`` CLI's own
``sessions export --dry-run`` rather than reading Hermes' SQLite store
directly, because that schema is internal and versioned. Only ended sessions
are ever candidates there (Hermes' own prune-candidate filter always
requires ``ended_at IS NOT NULL``), so a currently live session is never
listed -- that gap is a property of the data source, not data loss by this
module.
