"""Hermes skill provenance.

Evidence, in priority order: ``skills/.bundled_manifest`` (name:md5 of the
bundled package as of the last sync), ``skills/.hub/lock.json``, then
``skills/.usage.json``. Provenance has to come from recorded evidence, not
from guessing at names -- a skill named like a factory one can be entirely
user-written, and vice versa.

Manifest keys are written from the frontmatter ``name`` with the directory
name as fallback, so both are tried in that order. Measured against a real
install all 70 manifest entries matched by frontmatter name, the directory
name fallback never fired, and 12 of the 82 skills on disk are not in the
manifest at all. Two of those 82 do carry a frontmatter name that differs
from their directory name, so a single-key lookup would misread them.

When the manifest is absent nothing can be proven bundled, so everything is
reported as LOCAL_UNKNOWN and therefore imported. If this hash ever diverges
from upstream's, every bundled skill reads as modified and is imported: the
failure direction is redundancy, never data loss.
