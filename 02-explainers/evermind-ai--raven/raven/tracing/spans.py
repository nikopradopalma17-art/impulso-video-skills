    process served exactly one front end for as long as it lived. A gateway
    that hosts the page now serves several at once -- the browser page, the
    GUI shell, a relayed terminal -- so a turn may carry its own surface (see
    ``build_span``'s ``surface`` argument, fed from ``Source.surface``). This
    declaration remains the fallback for every span that does not: a host that
    serves one front end keeps declaring it here and nothing else changes.

    It exists because the terminal and the served page share the ``tui`` channel
    deliberately -- one session pool, so the same person sees the same
    conversations from either -- which leaves ``channel.id`` unable to tell a
    trace from one apart from a trace from the other. This is the dimension that
    can. Passing None clears it.
