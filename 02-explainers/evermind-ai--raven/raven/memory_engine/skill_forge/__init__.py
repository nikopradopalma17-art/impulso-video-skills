"""SkillForgeRouter machinery — multi-source skill retrieval + RRF fusion.

The package holds :class:`LocalSkillCatalog` (the local pool and its
rendering), the three sources :class:`LocalSkillSource`,
:class:`BackendSkillSource` and :class:`HubSkillSource`, the
:class:`SkillForgeRouter` that fans out over them with weighted RRF
(``rrf_merge_weighted``), the :class:`LLMGateFilter` and
:class:`QueryRewriter` downstream of the fusion, and ``resolve_refs``.
Its consumer is the context engine's skills segment.

The :class:`ForgeSkillSource` Protocol is **host-internal**: the sources are
hardcoded, not a plugin contribution point. Third-party extension of skill
retrieval happens through :class:`MemoryBackend`
(``backend.recall(agent_id=...)``) — the BackendSkillSource re-emits those
hits as :class:`RouterHit` records.
