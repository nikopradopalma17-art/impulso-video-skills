"""Weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion across heterogeneous skill sources.

The classic RRF formula sums ``1 / (rrf_k + rank_i(d))`` over the
sources that hit document ``d``. Multi-source skill retrieval needs a
small extension: each source carries a **trust weight** so curated
content (Local) outranks imported content (Mass) at equal rank. The
weighted form is::

    rrf_score(d) = Σ_i  w_i / (rrf_k + rank_i(d))

with ``rrf_k`` defaulting to :data:`RRF_K` and overridable per call or
via ``skillForge.router.rrfK``, and the per-source ``w_i`` coming from
the source's :attr:`ForgeSkillSource.weight` attribute. Note that ``rrf_k``
is the damping constant, distinct from the ``k`` argument of
:func:`rrf_merge_weighted`, which caps the output length.

Three additional behaviors are baked in:

- **Cross-source dedup by name.** A skill appearing in multiple
  sources (e.g. Local has the canonical version, EverOS has a
  self-evolved variant under the same name) collapses into one hit.
  RRF scores from both sources accumulate; the representative ``hit``
  is the one with the highest per-source ``score`` so the prompt sees
  the best version available.

- **Telemetry annotation.** Each output hit gets ``rrf_score`` and
  ``contributing_sources`` written into ``meta`` so a debug overlay /
  log line can trace which sources fed which slot.

- **Frozen-output discipline.** :class:`RouterHit` is frozen, so the
  fusion never mutates input hits in place — it constructs new hits
  via :func:`dataclasses.replace`. That keeps the source-side caches
  intact and makes the fusion safely re-runnable on the same inputs.

# Classic RRF uses 60, tuned for TREC-scale runs of ~1000 hits. Sources
# here return ~10, where 60 flattens the whole rank ladder to a 15% score
# spread -- narrower than the 1.0/0.85 source-weight gap, so weight alone
# decides the order and rank stops mattering. 10 keeps that ladder at 82%.

        dedup_by: :class:`RouterHit` attribute used as the cross-source

            sources surfacing a skill with the same display name are
            one logical skill. Tests pass ``"qualified_id"`` when they
            want to verify "no dedup happened" on disjoint hits.
