"""Query rewriter — judges whether skill retrieval is needed and rewrites
verbose queries into concise skill-routing queries.

One LLM call does two
things: (1) decide whether the user query needs external skill retrieval
at all (chat / greetings / general knowledge → skip the router fan-out
entirely); (2) when retrieval IS needed, strip noise (paths, IDs,
timestamps) and keep task type + domain so BM25 / dense fan-outs hit the
relevant skills.

Failures default to ``need_retrieval=True`` (safe fallback: keep doing
retrieval) so a flaky provider never silently turns off the skill lane.
