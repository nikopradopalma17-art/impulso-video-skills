"""LocalSkillSource — wraps :class:`LocalPool` to emit :class:`RouterHit`.

Hot-path observation: :class:`LocalPool` already returns the cheap
``ScoredSkill(name, score, source)`` triple. To produce a
:class:`RouterHit` we additionally need ``content`` (the SKILL.md body)
which :class:`SkillRegistry.get` already has cached in memory — so the
per-hit lookup is O(1) dict access, not a fresh disk read.

Hits whose name no longer resolves in the registry (race against a
file-watcher delete between BM25 scoring and meta lookup) are skipped
silently. The router's contract is "at most k hits", not "exactly k",
so dropping is safer than emitting a hit with empty content.
