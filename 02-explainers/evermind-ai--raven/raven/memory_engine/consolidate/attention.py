"""Parser / renderer for ``user_memory/attention.md``.

attention.md is sentinel/cron's projection of derived, time-sensitive
observations about the user — habits, predictions, pending decisions,
proactive ledger — into a single human-readable markdown file. Section
order is fixed by ``ATTENTION_SECTIONS`` (14 H2s including the
diagnostic). Each section's body is opaque to the parser; the
single-writer-per-H2 convention keeps concurrent producers from
stepping on each other under the shared ``attention.md.lock``.

Distinct from user.md (stable profile) and episodes.md (event log):
attention.md is **derived state** that's recomputed by sentinel/cron
producers each tick.
