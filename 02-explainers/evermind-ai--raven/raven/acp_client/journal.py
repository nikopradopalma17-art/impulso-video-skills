"""Every frame of one ACP connection, in wire order, on disk.

The turn collector in :mod:`raven.acp_client.acp_agent` records the
notifications routed to one session. That is what a reader of a delegated run
wants, and it is not the same thing as what crossed the wire. Four classes of
traffic never reached it, each invisible in a different way:

- **The agent's own requests.** ``session/request_permission`` is answered
  automatically and unattended (see :mod:`raven.acp_client.permissions`), so
  nothing anywhere could say what raven approved on a sub-agent's behalf.
- **Raven's outbound frames.** Which session was resumed, whether a cancel was
  sent, what the prompt actually was.
- **Notifications for a session no longer attached.** The router drops them with
  a debug line; a late ``usage_update`` after a turn settles is the ordinary
  case, and there was no record it ever arrived.
- **stderr.** An adapter has been measured reporting a fatal provider error
  there while the protocol still answered ``stopReason: end_turn``.

A journal is per connection rather than per call because an ACP session is: one
process serves every session of one agent, and the ``initialize`` handshake that
opens it belongs to no single call. A call names the byte range it occupied
instead, so its own record still points at exactly its own traffic.

On disk rather than in memory because "complete" and "bounded" cannot both hold
for a list -- a connection lives as long as the raven process, and one turn's
frames can run to megabytes. Bounded here means a byte ceiling per connection,
and reaching it is written down (:data:`_TRUNCATED`) rather than left to look
like a connection that went quiet.

Nothing here may fail a run: every write is best-effort, and a journal that
cannot open its file downgrades to recording nothing rather than raising into
the read loop.
