"""One live ACP connection per agent and parent binding, shared by every caller in this process.

Why a singleton rather than a field on the backend: ``SubagentManager`` and
``SubAgentDagTool`` each build their own backend object from the same config
(``loop/main.py`` hands the list to both setters), so a pool owned by a backend
instance would start two server processes for one agent -- one for ``spawn``, one
for ``run_subagent_dag`` -- neither aware of the other. Backends are also rebuilt
on every hot config apply, which would leak a process each time.

So the pool is module state keyed by agent name, and a backend is only its
client. That also matches the transport: ACP sessions live *inside* a
connection, so sharing the connection is what makes two sessions of the same
agent possible at all.

Under one name, one connection per parent binding. The binding (the model,
provider and protocol the invoking session runs on) reaches the worker as
launch environment, so two bindings are two processes -- but they are not two
configs, and a second binding must not close the first binding's connection
the way an operator's config edit does: a turn was running on it.
