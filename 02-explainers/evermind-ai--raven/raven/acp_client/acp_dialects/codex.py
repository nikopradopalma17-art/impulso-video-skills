"""codex-acp: reading eleven codex tools out of five ACP ``kind`` values.

The adapter reports a call three ways -- the spec's ``kind`` enum, a title
written for a human, and discriminators in ``rawInput`` and ``_meta`` that no
other adapter sends -- and none of the three is codex's model-facing tool name.
Two of those names survive anyway, because codex runs those tools as shell
commands and the command string is on the frame: ``apply_patch`` is argv[0] of a
real command, and an MCP call names its server and tool in ``rawInput``.

Measured on v1.1.14, and the read and command frames of v1.13.1 read the same. See
``docs/specs/2026-08-23-codex-acp-tool-parsing-design.md`` for the frame captures
every row here is read from.
