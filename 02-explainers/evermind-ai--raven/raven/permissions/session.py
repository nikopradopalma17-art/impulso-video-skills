"""What one conversation has settled for itself: its permission mode, and the
actions it has allowed for the rest of the session.

Set from a settings surface (``/perm smart`` in the TUI, the composer chip on
the web) through ``config.set`` with a ``session_id``; read by the gate on every
tool call through the turn's conversation id, so a switch holds from the next
call, and a sub-agent's task -- which inherits the turn -- reads the same one.

Kept the way a conversation's model is kept: in memory here, and on the
conversation's own record (``session.metadata["permissions_mode"]``, written
by the RPC handler) so a restart does not undo it. The loop registers the
reader for that record at construction; a conversation this process has not
heard of is looked up once, and the answer -- either way -- is remembered.
``permissions.mode`` in config stays the default a new conversation starts on.

The grants are memory only, on purpose. A key is the identity of one part of an
action -- for exec, one segment together with the machine and the directory it
runs in -- and an action is allowed when every one of its keys was granted; a
segment that a rule or the read-only list already covers needs no key. Nothing
is remembered about a refusal, and nothing survives the process: what should
outlive it is a rule in the config, which the same prompt can write.
