"""Build a StrategyRegistry from a ``TokenWiseConfig``.

Called from ``core.runtime.build_runtime``. This module is the single place
that translates config flags into a concrete registry, so callers do not need
to know which individual strategies exist; a default-on strategy whose
activation site is never called has no functional symptom, only a bill, which
is why the assembly lives in one function the parity guard covers.

Installed in this order: CacheOptimizer, then UsageTracker.

    If ``cfg`` is None or ``cfg.enabled`` is False, returns an empty registry
    (the agent loop treats this as a 100% pass-through).

    ``supports_caching`` should be :func:`caching_probe` over the provider the
    loop is being built with. Without it ``CacheOptimizer`` falls back to a
    model-string lookup that cannot see the gateway.

    Leave ``telemetry_dir`` unset outside tests: ``UsageTracker``'s default is
    the one directory ``settings.usage`` reads, so rows written anywhere else
    are invisible to the only reader that aggregates them.

    Also applies the one part of that config a registry cannot carry, because it
    is read where a request is built rather than where a turn is: the cache
    lifetime. Process-wide by necessity -- ``providers.pool`` rebuilds a
    provider from config on a model switch, so anything fixed at one
    construction is gone after the first one -- and set here because this is the
    one function that reads this config block.

    Breakpoint *ownership* is deliberately not set here. Suppressing the
    provider's own placement is the loop's job and it does it per turn, on the
    binding's provider. Anything this function could set would be wider than the
    requests the strategy it installs actually sees.

    Every value is read through :func:`_setting`, which falls back rather than
    raises. This is the seam a config file arrives at, and the fields here tune
    an optimisation: a value this function cannot make sense of has to cost the
    default, never the agent's ability to start. The setters it calls are strict
    for their own reasons -- an unrecognised cache ``ttl`` is accepted and billed
    upstream instead of refused -- and that strictness belongs one layer down
    from user input, not at it.

    Called for its effect as much as its return value, and safe to call again:
    the last call wins.
