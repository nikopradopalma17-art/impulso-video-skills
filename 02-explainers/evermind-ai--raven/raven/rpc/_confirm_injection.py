"""Monkey-patch helper that bridges ``typer.confirm`` into the ConfirmBroker.

Mirrors ``_console_injection``: a context
manager that temporarily replaces ``typer.confirm`` / ``click.confirm`` so the
7 destructive CLI call sites stay untouched while the prompt is answered over
RPC instead of read from the (non-TTY, EOF-immediately) dispatch stdin.

``typer.confirm is click.confirm`` (same object), but they are distinct module
attributes — both are patched and both restored in ``finally``.

Only entered when a ConfirmBroker is present (TUI production path). Outside the
context, ``typer.confirm`` retains its native real-TTY behavior, so the pure
CLI path is unchanged.

The bridge runs in the dispatch worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``); it hands
the coroutine to the server's event loop via ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` and
blocks on ``.result()``. The broker's hard limit guarantees ``.result()``
returns, so no extra timeout is needed here.
