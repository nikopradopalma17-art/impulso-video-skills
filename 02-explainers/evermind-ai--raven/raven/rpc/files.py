    panel all have to answer alike for a given file: two of them refusing while
    the one that renders bytes allowed it is how ``serve.json`` reached the page.

    ``workspace`` is agent home, not a session's working directory. The two
    exemptions are derived from it, and both exist for one reason: they are
    where the agent itself writes. The workspace lives *at* ``~/.raven/workspace``
    by default, and a turn's working directory at ``~/.raven/tmp/<channel>`` -- a
    sibling of the workspace since agent home and the working directory were
    split apart. Exempting only the first left the second denied, which is every
    artifact a chat has produced since that split: the page drew the delivery and
    then refused to open it. Anchoring on the working directory instead broke
    the other way: the derived exemptions then covered ``~/.raven/tmp/<channel>``
    and a sibling that does not exist, and every file the DAG runner writes under
    ``~/.raven/workspace/sessions/`` -- a sub-agent's report among them -- read
    as state. The state directory's secrets (``config.json``, ``oauth/``,
    ``serve.json``) are siblings of both, never inside either.

    ``also_written`` adds a session's pinned working directory when a caller has
    one, so a session bound to a directory under the state root keeps its files.
    Every exemption, derived or added, is held to the same direction check: only
    a subtree the state root contains earns one. A directory that IS the state
    root, or sits above it, would otherwise ride the exemption and expose
    ``serve.json`` through it.

    Two roots rather than one, because two are in use and they do not always
    agree: ``RAVEN_HOME`` moves ``serve.json`` and the runtime dir, while the
    credential store hangs off ``get_config_path().parent``. Unset they are the
