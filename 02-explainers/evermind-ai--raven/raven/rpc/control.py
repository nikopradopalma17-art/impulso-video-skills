"""The gateway control plane: the daemon's window for other raven processes.

A channel adapter is a live object owned by the ``raven gateway`` process, and
so is the running generation. Facts about them (is this channel actually
paired? what is the login QR? which generation is serving?) and commands on
them (start this adapter now, rebuild from config, stop) can only be answered
inside that process, so every other surface -- the terminal, the served page,
the CLI -- reaches them through this plane. The client side is
:mod:`raven.gateway.live_probe`, which discovers the endpoint through the
gateway lock payload; this module is the server side.

Charter (the whole vocabulary, pinned by ``tests/test_rpc_control.py``):

- runtime facts: ``gateway.channels.live``, ``gateway.channels.qr``,
  ``gateway.status``;
- host commands: ``gateway.channels.start``, ``gateway.reload``,
  ``gateway.shutdown``.

Never on this plane: turn or chat streams (those are the terminal dialect's,
over the page or TUI transports) and config writes (those go through the
``raven.config.update_*`` writers; ``gateway.reload`` is how a write takes
effect).

Trust: loopback only, a per-boot token sent as the first WebSocket text frame,
published beside the gateway lock with mode 0600. On POSIX that is the same
uid that could already signal the process; on Windows the payload's
protection is the profile directory's ACL. The internal contract is the
Pydantic models below plus the tests -- no OpenRPC document, no codegen: the
only client is another raven process.
