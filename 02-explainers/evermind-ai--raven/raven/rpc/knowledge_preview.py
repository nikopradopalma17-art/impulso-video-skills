"""The original file behind a knowledge document, for the page's viewer.

A knowledge base keeps the bytes it was given, and the page shows them: a
reader checking why a chunk says what it says wants the document, not a
paraphrase of it.

Addressed by document id, never by path. The blobs live under raven's state
directory, which ``rpc.files.resolve_readable`` refuses on purpose -- that
directory also holds provider credentials and ``serve.json``, whose token mints
session nonces, and the viewer's path policy exists to keep a page-chosen path
away from all of it. An id sidesteps the question rather than weakening the
answer: nothing the page sends names a location, the record says where the
bytes are, and the handle is served instead of the request's own path.

Two things the record knows that the stored copy does not. Blobs are written as
``blobs/<document_id>`` with no suffix, so the file on disk cannot say what it
is -- while ``source`` keeps the name it was uploaded under and ``media_type``
what that name meant. Both the content type and the CSP sandbox are decided
from that name for exactly this reason: read off the blob they would come back
as ``application/octet-stream`` with no ``allow-scripts``, which serves a PDF
as a download and renders it blank in the frame.
