"""asyncio JSON-RPC 2.0 server loop over a full-duplex socket.

Topology: the parent listens on a TCP-loopback socket; the Node child connects,
sends an auth token line, then exchanges newline-JSON frames over the same
connection. ``RpcServer`` is given the accepted socket *object* and wires it via
``loop.connect_accepted_socket`` (cross-platform: selector + proactor loops).
`RpcServer` owns the read pump (one line-delimited JSON frame per iteration),
dispatches concurrently via `asyncio.create_task` so a long-running streaming
subscription doesn't block other RPC calls, and serializes writes with an
`asyncio.Lock` so concurrent dispatch tasks can't interleave bytes on the wire.

Frame size limit: 1 MiB. Larger frames trigger immediate
shutdown of the connection.
