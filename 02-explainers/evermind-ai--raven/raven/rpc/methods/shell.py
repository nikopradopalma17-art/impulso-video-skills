"""``shell.exec`` RPC handler -- the TUI's ``!command`` escape.

ui-tui runs this for two things: a line the user prefixed with ``!``, and each
``$(...)`` span it interpolates before sending a prompt. Both are the human's
own command, so the agent-facing guards on ``ExecTool`` (deny-list, approval
prompt) do not apply -- a user who types ``!rm -rf build`` is not an agent that
needs talking out of it.

What does still apply is the sandbox. When a run is configured with one, the
command goes through that same executor, so this surface cannot be used to
reach the host from a session the operator deliberately confined. Only when
there is no live loop to borrow an executor from does it fall back to running
directly.
