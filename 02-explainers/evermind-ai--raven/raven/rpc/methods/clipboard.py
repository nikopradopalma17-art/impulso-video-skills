"""``clipboard.paste`` RPC handler -- pull an image off the system clipboard.

ui-tui calls this whenever a bracketed paste arrives carrying no text, which is
what a copied image looks like from a terminal's side, and again when the user
presses the paste hotkey outright.

Scope note: the response field ``attached`` stays ``False``. Attaching would
mean holding the image against the session until the next turn consumes it, and
that store is exactly what ``image.attach`` is stubbed out for -- Raven has no
per-session attachment buffer. Claiming ``attached: true`` would make the TUI
print "image attached" for an image the model never receives. So this saves the
image where the agent's file tools can read it and returns the path in
``message``; a turn that mentions the path can actually see it. When the
attachment store lands, this handler flips one field.
