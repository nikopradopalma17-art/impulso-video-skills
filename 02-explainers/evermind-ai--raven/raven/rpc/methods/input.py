"""``input.detect_drop`` RPC handler -- is this pasted text a dropped file?

ui-tui asks on every submit and on every paste, because a terminal reports a
drag-and-drop as ordinary pasted text and only the shape of that text says
whether a file was meant. The client deliberately does not parse it itself
(``useSubmission.ts``: "the backend's file-drop detection handles paths with
spaces, quotes, Windows drive letters, and escaped characters correctly") -- so
the parsing lives here, once, rather than in two dialects.

Detection is existence-based, never pattern-only: something that merely looks
like a path but is not on disk is far more likely to be prose about a path, and
rewriting the user's message on that guess is worse than missing a drop.
