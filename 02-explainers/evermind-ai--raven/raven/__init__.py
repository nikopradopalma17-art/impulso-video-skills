"""
Raven — Agent framework with intelligent context management, proactivity,
token efficiency, and skill self-evolution.

Four feature pillars:
    1. Context Management   — context_engine/          (Curator engine)
    2. Proactivity          — proactive_engine/        (Sentinel + Scheduler)
    3. Token Efficiency     — token_wise/
    4. Skill Self-Evolution — memory_engine/skill_forge/

The base agent runtime (agent/, channels/, cli/, config/, providers/,
routing/, session/, templates/, utils/) originated from the MIT-licensed
nanobot project by HKUDS. Feature pillars listed above are new to Raven.
