"""CacheOptimizer — places Anthropic ``cache_control`` breakpoints optimally.

Anthropic allows up to 4 ephemeral cache breakpoints per request. The cache
key for each breakpoint is every block *up to and including* that breakpoint,
so placement determines what is actually cacheable.

Placement, measured against the ``system_and_3`` strategy in
:mod:`raven.token_wise.system_and_tail_cache`:

When tools are present (common agent scenario):
    1. Tools list end — tool schemas rarely change; caching them saves the
       full schema re-send cost every call.
    2. The system message — on its **stable head** when it declares one
       (``prompt_cache.STABLE_PREFIX_KEY``), on its tail otherwise. The head is
       the only mark in this whole set that survives a turn: the rest of that
       message is the memory recall, the router's hits and the Curator's working
       state, all derived from what the user just said, and a cache covers
       everything in front of its breakpoint.
    3. ``messages[-2]`` — rolling tail; covers the intra-turn tool-chain
       prefix so each iteration only pays fresh for the newest result.
    4. ``messages[-1]`` — rolling tail; written as cache this call, read as
       cache next call; completes the rolling coverage.

    An end-of-system mark is *not* added beside the head one. Four is the whole
    budget, and 3 subsumes it: a cache keyed at ``messages[-2]`` already carries
    the entire system message, for exactly the calls where that message is
    unchanged -- the iterations within one turn. Across turns neither survives.

When no tools are present (pure conversation):
    1. The system message, same rule as above.
    2–4. Last 3 non-system messages (rolling window identical to Hermes's
         ``system_and_3`` — proven optimal for cross-turn prefix matching).

For models that do not support prompt caching, this strategy is a no-op.
Original messages and tools are *never* mutated; deep copies are taken for
every block that gets a ``cache_control`` marker.
