"""What a call cost, given what it used.

Available for explicit price comparisons. Runtime accounting and tracing use
provider-reported amounts instead; this estimate must not enter their totals.

The rates themselves are a fact about the provider's catalogue, so they come from
``raven.providers.rates``; what lives here is the arithmetic on top of them --
including Anthropic's ephemeral cache pricing, which is a billing rule rather
than a rate:

    cache read  -> 10% of prompt rate
    cache write -> 125% of prompt rate (ephemeral 5-min TTL)

Non-Anthropic providers (no cache support) pass ``cache_read_tokens=0``,
``cache_write_tokens=0`` and the function collapses to the standard formula.

The write multiplier is asked of ``providers.prompt_cache`` rather than fixed
here, because ``tokenWise.cacheTtl`` chooses it: an hour-long write costs 2.0x
the uncached prompt rate where the default five-minute one costs 1.25x.
