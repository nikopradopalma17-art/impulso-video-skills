"""Export sanitization for bug report packages — path removal and tree digests.

A Bug Report Package must not leak absolute local paths (POSIX, Windows drive,
or UNC), yet ``collect_bundle`` keeps the original absolute path of a missing
artifact in ``manifest.json`` and in un-rewritten ``*.artifact_path`` span
attributes, and free text (model output, tool output, user-typed problem
fields, residual-scan samples) can carry arbitrary paths. This module provides
the path parser shared by sanitization and the pre-export assertions, the
text- and tree-level sanitizers built on it, and the tree digest that freezes
an export snapshot's identity:

- :func:`find_absolute_paths` — locate absolute-path tokens in text. The rule
  is charset-independent: a ``/`` at the start of a line, after whitespace, or
  after a boundary character opens a token; a token before-quoted extends to
  the closing quote (spaces allowed), a bare token ends at whitespace or a
  terminator. URL paths are not local paths and are skipped. Over-matching is
  the accepted trade-off — a replaced ``/usr/bin/env`` costs little, a leaked
  path is a contract violation.
- :func:`sanitize_text` / :func:`sanitize_export_tree` — replace known local
  roots and every parsed token with ``[REDACTED:path]``; the tree variant also
  rewrites the structured ``missing_artifacts`` and ``*.artifact_path``
  fields, keeping the basename for diagnostics.
- :func:`scan_absolute_paths` — the assertion pass: re-run the same parser
  over a sanitized tree; any hit means the tree must not ship.
- :func:`tree_digest` — order-stable content digest over a directory tree,
  refusing symlinks and special files (an injected link can never "pass").

# there first). "file" is exempt from the exemption: a file:// path IS a local
# path. Bounded lookbehind window — URLs in bundle text are line-local.
# The run ends where a path token would end (_BARE_END), not only at whitespace:
# compact JSON and logged request lines glue a path to a URL through a quote or
# comma, and a run that swallows the quote reads that path as part of the URL --
# exempting from redaction exactly what has to be redacted. ":" stays inside the
# run so a port (https://host:8080/p) does not split it.
# "?" and "#" end the run too: what follows them is a query or a fragment, and
# a value there that looks like an absolute path is a path on this machine --
# a logged request line is exactly where one turns up. The cost is that a
# legitimate URL path used as a query value (?redirect=/login) is redacted as
# well; that direction loses a URL inside a report, the other loses a path out
# of one, and scan_absolute_paths is a hard stop rather than a warning, so the
# export cannot both exempt these and claim to carry no local paths.
