"""Verdict sidecar — task-outcome labels for attempts, outside tracing.

Tracing's ``status.code`` answers "did the code crash"; a verdict answers
"did the task succeed", and additionally separates agent failure from
infrastructure failure (the evolver's SOP distinction: an infra failure must
never be diagnosed as an agent failure). Tracing cannot know any of this, so
verdicts are written by whoever can judge — a user command, an eval judge, a
replay harness — into an append-only ``verdicts.jsonl`` next to the trace
logs, keyed by attempt id (the ``attempt_id`` field).

Append-only on purpose: verdicts from different sources coexist (a user's
"fail" and a judge's "fail" are two records), and re-judging appends rather
than rewrites, so the last record for an attempt is its current word.
