"""Trajectory layer over the tracing store.

Tracing records *what happened* (``audit.span.v1`` spans + artifacts, see
:mod:`raven.tracing`); this package adds the semantics that turn those records
into trajectories — addressable, labeled, retained units of agent work:

- ``verdict``  — the label sidecar. Task success/failure is not tracing's
  business (``status.code`` answers "did the code crash", not "did the task
  succeed"), so verdicts live in a separate append-only file keyed by
  attempt id, written by whoever can judge (user command, eval judge).
- ``store``    — pin registry, attempt definitions, and the rotation-
  transparent span reader. A pinned attempt is corpus, not diagnostics: any
  purge tooling must consult :func:`store.pins` before deleting spans or the
  artifacts they reference. Attempt definitions (``attempts.json``) are the
  mutable merge/split sidecar: an attempt id equals the trace id unless a
  definition groups several traces under one minted id.
- ``bundle``   — the bundle collector. Packs one attempt's spans, artifacts,
  session record, and verdicts into a self-contained offline directory (and
  pins the id, since bundling declares the trajectory corpus).
- ``redact``   — the sanitizer. Produces a redacted **copy** of a bundle
  (known secret values, credential patterns, residual scan); the original
  bundle is never modified.
- ``report``   — the shippable form: the redacted copy packed into a
  ``.tar.gz``, delivered through the pluggable :class:`report.Uploader`
  (v1: local file only).
- ``replay``   — deterministic replay. Feeds a bundle's recorded model
  replies and tool results back through the live harness (mock replay: no
  real tool ever executes), with strict/warn divergence policies.
- ``cassette`` — the minimizer. Shrinks a bundle to the exact surface replay
  consumes and redacts the result: the committable Trajectory Cassette the
  regression suite replays.
- ``regression`` — the regression-case layer: ``expect.yaml`` expectations
  (where the replay must diverge, what the live side must do there) evaluated
  against a cassette replay, driving ``tests/trajectories/``.

The address unit is the **attempt**: one task try, possibly spanning several
turns. At read time an attempt id equals the trace id unless a definition in
``attempts.json`` groups several traces under one minted id — so every trace
is addressable as an attempt with zero ceremony. Old logs may carry a legacy
span-level ``attempt.id`` attribute, which read paths keep resolving.
