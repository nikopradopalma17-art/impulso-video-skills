"""Bundle collector — one trajectory packed into a self-contained directory.

A bundle is the offline form of a trajectory: everything needed to inspect
(and later report or replay) one attempt, collected out of the live tracing
store into a single directory that survives log rotation, artifact cleanup,
and being copied to another machine::

    <out>/<attempt_id>/
      manifest.json     # format version, ids, time range, counts, raven version
      spans.jsonl       # every span of the attempt, in write order
      artifacts/        # every file the spans' *.artifact_path attrs referenced
      session.jsonl     # the session's conversation record (omitted if missing)
      verdicts.jsonl    # every verdict recorded for the attempt

Artifact references inside ``spans.jsonl`` are rewritten to bundle-relative
paths (``artifacts/<name>``) so the bundle reads offline; missing artifact
files are skipped and listed in the manifest rather than failing the pack. An
``audit.artifact.v2`` artifact is resolved on the way in - its message
references are replaced by the messages themselves - so a bundle carries no
dependency on the live message store, and an address whose blob is gone
becomes a labelled placeholder listed under the manifest's
``missing_messages``.
A trace id addressing a multi-turn attempt is resolved to the canonical
attempt id first, so the bundle always holds the whole trajectory. The
bundle is built in a staging directory and swapped in whole, so a re-pack
never leaves stale files from a previous pack behind. Bundling declares the
trajectory corpus, so the id is auto-pinned.
