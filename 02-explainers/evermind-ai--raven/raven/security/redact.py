"""Strip credentials out of anything on its way to the client.

An ACP payload is a publishing surface: a tool title, a permission prompt and an
error message are all rendered in an editor, and some of them are persisted in
its transcript. Four channels carry secrets into that surface today, all of them
measured rather than imagined:

* a tool's arguments go on the wire verbatim, and for ``exec`` that is the whole
  command line -- ``curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-..."`` included;
* ``read_file`` has no fence by default (``restrict_to_workspace`` is false), so
  its result preview can be ``~/.aws/credentials``;
* every internal dispatcher error returns a ``traceback_tail``, whose last
  twelve lines carry absolute paths and sometimes argument values;
* an ``mcpServers`` entry carries an ``env`` dict.

What this is not: a general secret scanner. Only the capture group is replaced,
so the shape of the text survives and a person can still tell *what* was run --
``curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [redacted]"`` is a readable line, and a wholesale
match replacement would leave a row nobody can act on. The pattern list is the
same size as the one openclaw uses for the same job (about sixteen), and
deliberately not the 409-line RFC-7235 header scanner sitting next to it.

The same table scrubs a command the outbound client writes to its log when it
refuses a sub-agent's request (``raven/acp_client/permissions.py``): that
command is the sub-agent's to author and the log is retained. Seated in
``raven.security`` rather than in ``raven.acp`` because the client may not import
the server package.

Redaction is defence in depth, not the mechanism. A tool whose output must never
leave the process should not be put on the wire in the first place.
