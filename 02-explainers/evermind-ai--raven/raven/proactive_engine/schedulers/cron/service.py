           return it. Catches the case where the LLM creates the same

           medication-reminder string appearing as both an ``at`` shot
           today and a ``cron_expr`` recurring tomorrow — identical
           text, different fire times).

        2. **Time-window dedup**: if any existing enabled job for the
           same (channel, to) is scheduled to fire within 15 minutes of
           this new schedule's next fire (regardless of schedule kind),
           return it. Catches the case where the LLM creates both a
           recurring ``cron_expr`` AND a same-day ``at`` shot for the
           same intent (e.g. "daily 8:00 take meds" + "today 8:00 take
           meds").

        ``job_id`` edits one named job rather than adding: if a job with that id
        exists it is updated in place, otherwise the id is used for the new job.
        A job's run history lives in its ``cron:<id>`` session, so an edit that
        minted a fresh id would orphan it. It also skips every dedup layer
        below, which answer "is this the same reminder as some other job" -- a
        question an edit has already answered by naming the job it edits.
