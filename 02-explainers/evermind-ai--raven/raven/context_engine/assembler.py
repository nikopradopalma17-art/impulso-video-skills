"""ContextAssembler — the single context engine.

Assembles a uniform list of :class:`SegmentBuilder` into the turn's
message array. Two phases:

- **Phase A (parallel)** — every builder with ``needs_prefix=False``
  (seg1–5: identity / bootstrap / memory / active-skills / skills) runs
  concurrently. Their ``text`` joins into the system prefix; their
  ``meta`` merges into the assembled metadata.
- **Phase B (serial)** — builders with ``needs_prefix=True`` (the
  Curator) run with ``ctx.prefix`` populated (the assembled prefix +
  user message + tool defs), so they size ``*history`` against the exact
  fixed overhead. The Curator contributes segment 6 (``text``) and the
  history slot (``history``).

The user message is a structural built-in (every turn has exactly one),
not a pluggable builder. Tools are a side channel — passed to the LLM
alongside ``messages`` and counted in the budget, never rendered into a
segment.

    The separator that follows the run is counted in, so the boundary falls
    between two segments rather than inside the join.

    ``tail_follows`` says something is appended after these parts -- phase B,

    part. On its own that boundary would sit at the end of the message and cache
    nothing the end-of-message breakpoint does not, so it is not declared. With
    volatile text appended after it, it is the only breakpoint in the message
    that survives a turn, and declining to declare it gave up the whole point of
    measuring this: identity and bootstrap present, memory and both skill
    segments contributing nothing, Curator appending -- a reachable
    configuration, and one where the assembled message went out as
    ``IDENTITY<sep>CURATOR`` with no key at all.
