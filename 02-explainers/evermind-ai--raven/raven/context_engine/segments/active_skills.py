        An always-skill is resident unconditionally, so without this it can

        ``tools.disabled_tools``. Segment 5 gets the same protection from the
        LLM gate's hard-constraint block; segment 5's is advisory, this one is
        a filter.

        Unlike ``requires.bins`` / ``requires.env`` (process-static, resolved
        in the registry) the tool set is live and hot-appliable, so it is
        checked here, per turn, against the definitions actually being sent.
