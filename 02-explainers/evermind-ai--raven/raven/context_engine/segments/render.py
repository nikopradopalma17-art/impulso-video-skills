    token-estimation path -- must agree on it without either being told.

    Both bullets are claims about *this process*, and that is load-bearing rather

    a dispatched DAG node and a person's direct chat, and the variable cannot tell
    them apart. An earlier draft said the reply was "not shown to a person" and that
    "nothing follows this turn": true of a dispatched node, false of a direct chat,
    where the reply streams to the person and the instance stays available.

    The second bullet is conditional for a second reason, and the qualifier is the
    whole of it. An acp process is wired with a cron service and so registers ``cron``
    (``WiringMixin``, gated on ``cron_service``), and ``build_rpc_stack`` starts that
    service with ``make_on_session_wake`` precisely so a fired job runs later on the
    session that armed it. A flat "nothing runs after your turn ends" would therefore
    contradict a delivery the process really does make, and tell a model that its own

    """User message content with attachments.

    Images are inlined as base64 ``image_url`` blocks so a vision-capable model
    sees them directly, downscaled and recompressed first by the same
    preprocessing ``read_file`` uses: a phone photo is several megabytes and
    thousands of patch tokens, and every target either refuses it or downsizes it
    server-side and bills for the original. Returns a plain ``str`` when there
    are no image blocks.

    Non-image attachments (PDF, audio, Office docs, …) can't ride in the message,
    so their paths are surfaced as a text note for the model to read on demand.

    Each image also gets its path named in the text, the same way non-image
    attachments already do. The base64 lives for exactly this turn — it is
    replaced by a placeholder on the way into the session — so without the path
    the model loses any way to look at the picture again, and a follow-up
    question about it has nothing to work from.

    ``can_see_images=False`` (the model has no vision) turns a picture into the
    same kind of note the other attachments get. Said out loud rather than
    dropped: a text-only endpoint handed an image block either rejects the
    request or, worse, discards the picture and answers anyway. Lazy on purpose —
    describing every attachment up front would spend a vision call on the ones a
    turn only means to move or rename.

    ``describe_tool`` names the tool that can read an attachment, or is ``None``
    when no such tool is registered (it is contributed by the EverOS plugin and
    absent on a default install). Pointing at a tool the model does not have
    reads as an instruction it cannot follow, so the note then says only what is
    there and leaves the path.

    Anything refused -- an unreadable file, one too large, an image past a
    ceiling -- becomes a note as well. This runs deep inside turn assembly, where
    a raised ``OSError`` surfaces as a failed turn rather than as a sentence about
    one attachment.
