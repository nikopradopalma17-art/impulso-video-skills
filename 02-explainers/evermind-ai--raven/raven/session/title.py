"""Model-generated session titles: the prompt, the call, and the cleanup.

Naming a session is a side errand, not part of the turn: the caller fires this
concurrently with the turn it names and takes the mechanical title already in
place (``manager.derive_title``) whenever anything here declines to answer.
Every failure mode therefore returns ``None`` rather than raising -- a session
that could not be named is not a session that failed.

The numeric bounds here are runaway guards, not layout rules. Measured titles
run 2-21 codepoints, so ``TITLE_BUDGET`` is not what shapes a normal title; it
is what stops a model that ignored the instruction from writing a paragraph
into session metadata. How a title *fits* is the front end's business -- both
surfaces already truncate with an ellipsis and neither writes that truncation
back.
