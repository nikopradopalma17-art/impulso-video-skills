"""The two global tools through which the model reaches MCP prompts.

Global with a ``server`` argument, for the same reason as the resource tools:
two schemas whatever the server count, so growing the server set never pushes a
deploy over the tool-folding threshold.

A deliberate departure from the MCP spec, recorded because it is a real cost.
The spec positions prompts as *user*-selected templates, and recommends a slash
command as the carrier. Reaching them through tools makes them
model-selected instead. What that buys is zero change to the interaction layer:
the slash route needs a command registry that accepts outside contributions,
and ``commands.catalog`` is a pure reflection of the Typer app, while
``slash.exec`` returns display text that cannot become this turn's user input.

Because the product lands in a tool result rather than as user input, the
fencing every tool result gets applies unchanged -- and unlike the slash route,
fencing does not defeat the purpose here. On the slash route the expanded prompt
*is* the turn's instruction, so declaring it data would waste it; that is why
that route needs a per-server trust level and this one does not.
