"""Model-facing names for MCP tools.

The name a server advertises is not usable as-is: two servers may advertise the
same tool name, and neither is guaranteed to be spelled in what the providers
accept. This module is the single place that turns a ``(server, tool)`` pair
into the string the model sees.

What the providers accept -- the character set and the 64-character cap, and the
sources that were checked for it -- belongs to
:mod:`raven.providers.tool_names`, which is where the constraint comes from.

    pair's spellings forward and test membership.

    At most three exist:

    1. the raw form, from before names were sanitised or capped at all;
    2. the plain sanitised form, which is what a pair gets when nothing
       collides with it -- and which a pair that overflows the cap never gets,
       because :func:`tool_name` makes the suffix mandatory for those. Offering
       it anyway would answer a config entry with a spelling no build ever
       registered, so nobody could have copied it from anywhere;
    3. the suffixed form, which is what a pair gets when something collides,
       or when it overflows.

    All of them come from the pair alone. That matters most for the third:
    which of two colliding tools actually receives the suffix depends on which
    connect commits first -- concurrent, so not even stable across restarts --
    but the *spelling* does not, so an entry naming it keeps meaning the same
    tool after the other server is removed or the race lands the other way.
