"""OAuth 2.1 for remote MCP servers — the three pieces the SDK leaves to us.

``mcp.client.auth.OAuthClientProvider`` implements the whole spec-side flow
(RFC 9728 resource discovery, RFC 8414 AS metadata discovery, RFC 7591
dynamic client registration, PKCE, token refresh). What it delegates to the
host, and what this module provides:

- token/client persistence  -> :class:`FileTokenStorage`
  (``~/.raven/credentials/mcp/<server>.json``, 0600, atomic writes)
- opening the browser        -> :class:`_Flow` (also notifies the GUI over
  the ``oauth.pending`` / ``oauth.done`` events)
- receiving the redirect     -> a module-level pending map keyed by the
  OAuth ``state``; the gateway's ``/oauth/callback`` route (or the
  self-hosted fallback listener) calls :func:`resolve_callback`

The pending map and callback base are module-global on purpose: the loopback
redirect URL is a process-wide resource (``rpc.serve_control.SERVE`` follows the
same pattern). The ``state`` value is read from the authorization URL the SDK
hands to ``redirect_handler`` — the SDK generates it, we only correlate.

A server's config may also carry the discovery results themselves
(``MCPOAuthConfig``, filled in by a PlugHub install from the catalog entry). When
it does, :func:`provider_for` seeds them instead of fetching them, so the
browser opens without the RFC 9728/8414 round trips in front of it -- and with a
pre-registered ``client_id``, without the registration round trip either. An
endpoint the server answers as not being there is disarmed and the next connect
discovers; see :class:`_CatalogSeed` and :data:`NO_SEED_ENV`.

The consumer is :class:`~raven.mcp.manager.MCPConnectionManager`:
for a server configured ``auth="oauth"`` it builds a provider through
:func:`provider_for` and hands it to the transport as an ``httpx.Auth``, so the
SDK runs the browser flow *inside* the connect. A connect that still fails is
classified by :func:`is_auth_error` and parked as ``auth_required`` --
deliberately not retried, until an explicit ``connect()`` (``plug.auth``).
