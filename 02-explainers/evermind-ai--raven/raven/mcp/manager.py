"""Per-server MCP connection lifecycle.

The live path for every MCP server the agent loop talks to: each server owns
a private ``AsyncExitStack`` so it can be attached, detached, and reconnected
independently while the loop runs (plugin install/uninstall, re-auth, config
edits -- no restart).

Ordering constraint worth flagging: ``disconnect`` withdraws the server's
tools *before* closing its stack, so the agent never sees a tool whose session
is already gone. A turn already in flight had those tools in its prompt, so its
next call lands on the registry's not-found answer, which names both readings
("unloaded, or the name is wrong") rather than accusing the model of guessing.

Locking model: the manager lock guards only the connection map and the
begin/commit edges of a connect. The transport handshake itself runs
*outside* the lock — an OAuth connect legitimately blocks for minutes while
the user is in the browser, and the 5s ``reload.mcp`` poll must keep getting
answers meanwhile. Each connect attempt carries an ``epoch`` token; commit
verifies the record still wants this attempt (same epoch, still
``connecting``) and rolls the attempt back otherwise, so a concurrent
disconnect/config-change during the handshake wins cleanly.

State transitions (``apply_config``/``connect`` drive them):

    disconnected -> connecting -> connected
                        |-> auth_required   (OAuth needed / token expired /
                        |                    parked at the browser step)
                        `-> error           (kept until config changes or an
                                             explicit connect() retries it —
                                             the 5s reload poll must not turn
                                             a dead server into a retry storm)

``auth_required`` is reached two ways. A connect that *failed* with an auth
error rests there until an explicit ``connect()``. A background connect that
*parked* at the browser-authorization step is moved there immediately — while
its attempt keeps running: ``sync`` stops awaiting it, the state tells every
poller who the wait is on, and if the user completes the authorization the
still-live attempt commits and the server flips to ``connected`` on its own.
The commit/abort checks therefore accept ``auth_required`` alongside
``connecting`` when the epoch matches.

        which attempt a name belongs to. The record's epoch can: it names the
