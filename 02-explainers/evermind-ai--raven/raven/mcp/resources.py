"""The three global tools through which the model reaches MCP resources.

Global, with a ``server`` argument, rather than a wrapper pair per server. That
is what Claude Code, Codex and opencode all do, and the reason is schema cost:
per-server wrappers grow the tool array with the number of servers, which pushes
a deploy over the tool-folding threshold and costs the prompt-cache prefix. Three
tools cost the same whether one server serves resources or ten.

They are registered only when some connected server declared the ``resources``
capability, and every call re-checks the server it names. The gate is the
registration; the re-check covers the window between two config applies, in which
a server can go away or come back with different capabilities.

Resources are *data*, not instructions -- the model asks for them and gets file
contents back. They land in a tool result, so they inherit the same fencing every
other tool result gets, with no special handling here.
