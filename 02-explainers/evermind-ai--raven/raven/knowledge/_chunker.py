"""Chunkers: a parser's sections become the pieces that get embedded.

A chunker never merges across a section boundary -- that is what keeps the
structure a parser found (a heading, a page, a slide) from being averaged away
before anything is retrieved.

    Subclasses implement a specific chunking strategy (by character
    count, by token count, by semantic boundary, etc.).  The
    chunker is configured once at construction time and reused
    across many ``chunk()`` calls within the same knowledge base.

    Subclasses must guarantee:

    - **No cross-Section merging**: every output :class:`Chunk` is
      derived from exactly one input :class:`Section`.
    - **DataBlock pass-through**: a Section whose content is a
      :class:`DataBlock` becomes a single Chunk
      with the same content; multimodal data is never sliced.
    - **Continuous indexing**: ``chunk_index`` runs from ``0`` to
      ``total_chunks - 1`` across the entire output list, even
      when the input contains many Sections.
    - **Consistent total_chunks**: every output Chunk carries the
      same ``total_chunks`` value (the length of the output list).
    - **Metadata inheritance**: each output Chunk's ``source`` and
      ``metadata`` are copied from its parent Section.
