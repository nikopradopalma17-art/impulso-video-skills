"""What knowledge bases and their documents are, and where that survives.

Two stores, deliberately: the vectors live in the collection, and everything a
page needs to *list* one -- names, sizes, indexing state, the error a failed
document stopped on -- lives here as JSON. Splitting them is what lets the
knowledge page answer without touching the index, and what makes an
interrupted index recoverable: a document is a record with a status long
before it is a set of vectors.

One JSON file, written the way the rest of the runtime writes its state: a
temp file and ``os.replace``. The disk under a deployment can reach zero free
mid-write, and a truncating write there does not fail -- it leaves an empty
file where the registry was.
