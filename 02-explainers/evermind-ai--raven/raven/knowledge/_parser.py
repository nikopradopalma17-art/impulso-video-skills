A parser handles one format family and preserves boundaries; it never chunks.
Adopted from AgentScope's own implementation (Apache-2.0; see NOTICES.md). Only
the text family ships in the package; PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint parsers
each need a third-party library and arrive with the optional extra that carries
those.

        The ``file`` argument is a union covering the three call sites
        a parser sees in practice:

        - ``bytes`` — the raw payload, as handed in by HTTP uploads
          and blob-store reads.
        - ``str`` for binary parsers (PDF, PPT, image, …) — a
          **filesystem path** to the file to read.  The parser opens
          the path itself; callers do not need to read the bytes first.
        - ``str`` for :class:`TextParser` — disambiguated at runtime:
          if the string names an existing file on disk it is treated
          as a path and the file is decoded with the configured
          encoding; otherwise it is treated as pre-decoded text.
