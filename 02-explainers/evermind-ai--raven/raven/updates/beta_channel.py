"""The beta channel: pre-release builds served from a GitLab package registry.

Stable Raven upgrades itself from GitHub releases (``upgrade_commands``). Test
builds never reach GitHub, so they need a second source: a GitLab generic
package registry holding the wheels, plus one pointer file naming the newest of
them. The pointer exists because a read-only deploy token cannot list a
registry -- it can only fetch a path it already knows -- so the publisher
overwrites a fixed path instead of the reader searching.

An install joins the channel by having ``~/.raven/beta.json``, which the beta
installer writes and nothing else does. Delete it and every entry point below
falls back to GitHub, which is also how a tester leaves the channel.

The token in that file can fetch packages from one project and nothing else:
the repository endpoints answer 404 to it and ``git clone`` is refused. It
still reaches ``uv`` inside the wheel URL, so it shows up in that process's
argv -- acceptable for a credential whose whole power is downloading builds we
are handing to the holder anyway, and the reason the file is 0600.
