"""Startup update nudge for the TUI status bar.

The status bar's right slot shows an "update available" hint in place of the
cwd/branch label when the session init bundle carries ``update_available`` /
``update_command`` (see ``ui-tui/src/components/appChrome.tsx``); this module
is what fills those in.

The live check reads the release page redirect (not the releases API, whose
unauthenticated quota is 60 requests per hour per IP -- a daily check from every
install behind one egress is enough to drain it, and a nudge must not cost the
budget that ``raven upgrade`` needs). An install that joined the beta channel
asks that channel's own registry instead, which never used the API to begin with.
Either way it is too slow for the session-create hot path, so we keep a small
cache in the runtime cache dir and refresh it in a daemon thread at most once a
day. A launch therefore shows the notice based on the *cached* latest version;
the first launch after a release lands refreshes the cache and the notice appears
on the next launch. Any network or parse failure is swallowed -- an update nudge
must never break startup.

That TTL governs the cached path only. ``check_for_update`` bypasses it on
purpose, and the served page calls it on every boot as well as behind its
settings button -- a banner that names a version has to name the one the
upgrade will install, which a day-old cache cannot promise. So the TTL bounds
how often a *launch* touches the network, not how often this module does.

The cache also holds the ETag of the last beta pointer it read, which is what
lets a resident gateway poll that channel every minute (see
``serve_commands._UPDATE_POLL_BETA_S``): the validator goes back out as
``If-None-Match``, and an unchanged channel answers 304 with no body to parse.
A 304 still stamps ``checked_at`` -- the check happened and its answer was
"unchanged", which is exactly what the TTL wants to know.

Set ``RAVEN_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`` to opt out of both the fetch and the hint.
