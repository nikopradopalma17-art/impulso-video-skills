"""Delivery: what a channel can do (Capabilities), the streaming opt-in
(SupportsStreaming), the per-channel send surface (Outlet), and the hub that
routes each deliverable to its outlet (DeliveryHub).

The hub keeps one bounded queue and one serial worker per outlet: a deliverable
is routed by its source channel into that outlet's queue, and the queue is the
backpressure point — a full queue blocks only that channel's sender, never the
others (no cross-outlet head-of-line blocking), while same-channel order is held
by the single worker. This mirrors the lane model on the delivery side.

spine never imports channels; channels import the vocabulary here (via the
channels.contract re-export), not the reverse.
