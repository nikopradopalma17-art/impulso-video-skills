"""Eval Engine — L3 cognition-coord task judge.

Provides three AgentHook implementations that ride
on AgentLoop's lifecycle phases to answer three orthogonal questions:

- ``BeforeIterationHook``  — "should we even start the next iteration?"
                              (token budget / pruning)
- ``ToolAuditHook``         — "is this tool call safe to execute?"
                              (deny-list / approval workflow stub)
- ``AfterIterationHook``    — "did this turn complete successfully?"
                              (LLM judge over the final response;
                              appends a HISTORY.md line through the
                              MemoryStore adapter)

All three are **off by default** (``EvalEngineConfig.enabled = False``).
Mounting them onto AgentLoop happens via the CLI stack — see
``raven/core/eval_stack.py`` for the builder (unwired today; see CONTEXT.md).
