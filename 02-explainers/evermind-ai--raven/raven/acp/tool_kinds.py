"""Classify a raven tool call for a client that has to draw it.

``ToolKind`` picks an icon and lets a client optimise how it renders progress.
It is optional in the schema, so the cost of getting it wrong is cosmetic and
the cost of omitting it is also cosmetic -- which is exactly why this file is
small and refuses to guess. Every name raven actually registers is mapped;
anything else, including the ``mcp_<server>_<tool>`` names an MCP server brings
at runtime, is ``other``. A wrong icon is worse than a generic one.

``locations`` is not cosmetic. The spec requires paths inside the protocol to be
absolute, and raven's file tools accept workspace-relative ones, so a location
forwarded verbatim points a client's "follow along" cursor at a path that
resolves somewhere else entirely -- or, on the client's side, at nothing. The
extractor therefore takes the session's working directory and resolves against
it, and drops anything it cannot make absolute rather than sending a relative
path the spec forbids.
