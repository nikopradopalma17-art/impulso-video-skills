"""What this agent tells the client it can do, and what the client told us.

Both halves matter and only one of them is usually written. An agent that
declares a capability it does not serve produces the worst failure shape in the
protocol: the client routes work through a method that answers with an error,
and the turn stalls on a promise nobody will keep. So every flag here is false
unless something downstream actually honours it, and each one names what would
have to exist for it to flip.

The inbound half is kept rather than read and dropped. ``ask_user`` has no tool
call to attach, and ``RequestPermissionRequest.toolCall`` is required, so the
routing decision for a bare question depends on whether the client declared
``elicitation`` -- a decision that cannot be made at the point of asking if the
declaration was thrown away at the handshake.
