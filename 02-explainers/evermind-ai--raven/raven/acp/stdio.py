"""Making stdout safe to speak a protocol on.

An ACP agent's stdout is a JSON-RPC channel, not a place to print. Every other
writer in the process shares that descriptor -- an embedded structlog, a library
banner, a traceback, a ``print`` left behind from a debug session -- and one line
from any of them is a frame the client cannot decode. What the client sees is not
"raven logged something"; it is a protocol violation, and the session it was half
way through is gone.

Nothing here knows an ACP method name. This is the layer that makes the channel
speakable, kept apart from anything that speaks.

    """Hand the protocol its own descriptor, and point fd 1 at stderr.

    The returned writer owns a duplicate of the original fd 1. For the duration
    of the block fd 1 *is* stderr, so anything that writes to stdout by any
    route -- ``sys.stdout``, ``os.write(1, ...)``, a C extension holding the
    descriptor, an embedded logger with its own stream -- lands in the log
    instead of the frame stream.

    Replacing ``sys.stdout`` alone would not do: it covers only writers that go
    through Python's own object, which is precisely the set that was never the
    problem. The descriptor is the shared resource, so the descriptor is what
    gets moved.

    The writer is buffered and :func:`write_frame` flushes each frame, rather
    than unbuffered. A raw ``FileIO.write`` is a single ``write(2)`` that may
    return fewer bytes than it was handed, and nothing in the return value is
    checked -- so a short write would be a silently truncated frame, with the
    next frame concatenating onto its tail. ``BufferedWriter.flush`` retries
    short writes itself and raises ``BlockingIOError`` rather than discarding.
    Flushing per frame keeps the property that matters: a frame left in a buffer
    is a client waiting forever for a reply that was already computed, which
    reads as a hang rather than as slowness and is the harder of the two to
    diagnose.

    This is not hypothetical here. ``_open_stdin``'s ``connect_read_pipe`` sets
    ``O_NONBLOCK`` on fd 0's open file description, and an interactive shell
    hands a foreground job fd 0, 1 and 2 as dups of one description -- so the
    flag lands on this descriptor too whenever somebody runs ``raven acp`` in a
    terminal rather than letting an editor spawn it.

    Two failures are answered rather than raised. An agent that dies on
    malformed input leaves every pending request unresolved, and a client whose
    promise never settles is worse off than one holding an error: it has nothing
    to show the user and nothing to retry.

    - A line longer than ``max_frame_bytes``. The oversized bytes are dropped up
      to and including their newline, so the next frame starts where a frame
      starts. Both the error and the resynchronisation are the point: without
      the drop, reading resumes in the middle of the discarded frame and every
      frame after it is garbage too.
    - A line that is not a JSON object.

    Both are reported through ``on_protocol_error`` as a JSON-RPC error frame
    with a null ``id``, because the id lived in the bytes that could not be
    read. EOF ends the iteration: that is the client closing the session, not a
    failure to report to it.

    ``StreamReader.readuntil``'s. ``readuntil`` raises ``LimitOverrunError``

    chunks to drain it would swallow the start of the following frame, which is
