"""Let the agent ask its user a question, over a protocol with no method for it.

``ask_user`` is a tool: the model calls it, the runtime emits a
``clarify.request`` notification and blocks the tool call until somebody answers.
Over ACP that notification has nowhere to go, and the shape of the failure is the
worst kind -- the turn does not error, it *stalls*, for the ten minutes the
broker waits before falling back to the question's default. A client shows a
spinner the whole time and then a reply that ignores what it asked.

ACP has no "ask a question" method, so there are two routes and the client's
declared capabilities pick between them:

* **``elicitation/create``**, when the client declared form support. This is the
  right fit: a message plus a schema describing one field, answered with a value.
* **``session/request_permission``** otherwise. A worse fit, and the reason it is
  needed at all: ``RequestPermissionRequest.toolCall`` is *required*, so a bare
  question has to arrive wearing a tool call it does not have. The synthesised
  one is marked in ``_meta`` rather than disguised, and the options are the
  question's own choices -- which only works because ``ask_user`` usually has
  them.

**A free-text question with no elicitation cannot be answered.** A permission
response carries an option id and nothing else, so there is no channel for typed
text. Rather than inventing an answer or hanging, the question is put on the wire
as an ordinary agent message -- the person sees what was asked and can answer it
in their next prompt -- and the tool falls back to its default. Said out loud in
the compatibility matrix, because a silently defaulted question reads as an agent
that did not listen.
