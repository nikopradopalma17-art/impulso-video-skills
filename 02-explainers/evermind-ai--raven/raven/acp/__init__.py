"""Raven as an ACP agent: the stdio channel, and the protocol served over it.

An editor spawns ``raven acp`` as a subprocess and speaks newline-delimited
JSON-RPC to its stdin and stdout. That makes fd 1 a wire rather than a console,
which is the constraint this package is organised around: :mod:`raven.acp.stdio`
makes the channel safe to speak on, and everything else speaks.

The layers, outermost first:

* :mod:`raven.acp.stdio` -- descriptors and framing. Knows nothing about ACP.
* :mod:`raven.acp.protocol` -- the wire helpers the agent direction needs, on top
  of the framing already proven in :mod:`raven.acp_client.protocol`.
* :mod:`raven.acp.capabilities` -- what this agent declares, and what the client
  declared back.
* :mod:`raven.acp.updates` -- the outbound translator, which is also where a
  session's turn state lives, because the turn's stop reason arrives on the event
  stream rather than as a return value.
* :mod:`raven.acp.tool_kinds` -- classifying a tool call for a client that draws it.
* :mod:`raven.acp.outbound` -- requests this agent makes of the client, and the
  answers coming back. Nothing in raven had this: the dispatcher is inbound-only
  and ``send_frame`` is fire-and-forget.
* :mod:`raven.acp.permissions` -- the shell-approval round trip over
  ``session/request_permission``. A second transport for raven's existing
  approval decision, not a second decision.
* :mod:`raven.security.redact` (not in this package) -- credentials out of
  anything on its way to the client, because an ACP payload is rendered in an
  editor and often kept there. It sits below both ACP directions so the
  outbound client's refusal log is scrubbed by the same table.
* :mod:`raven.acp.methods` -- the inbound methods, each mapped onto an RPC call
  that already exists.
* :mod:`raven.acp.server` -- one connection: its engine, its frame loop, its
  teardown.

The opposite direction -- raven spawning somebody else's ACP agent -- already
exists under :mod:`raven.acp_client` and is not this. The two share only the wire
layer in :mod:`raven.acp_client.protocol`, which is imported rather than copied.
