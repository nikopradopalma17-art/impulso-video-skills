"""The ACP wire layer as the agent direction needs it.

Framing is not re-implemented: :mod:`raven.acp_client.protocol` already encodes
and decodes newline-delimited JSON-RPC, byte for byte the same as
``raven/rpc/server.py`` does, and has been run against real agents. It is
imported rather than copied, and rather than moved -- moving it would touch 78
tests belonging to the client direction for no user-visible gain.

What is added here is what only the agent direction needs:

* an ``id`` that may be a string. The client mints request ids, and JSON-RPC
  allows a string; the client-direction helper types it ``int`` because raven
  was the one minting. A client sending ``"id": "req-1"`` is legal and must be
  answered on the same id.
* ``data`` on an error. The ACP error codes carry structured detail (which
  session was not found, which field was rejected), and a client showing a
  person why the handshake failed needs more than a sentence.
* the ACP-assigned codes, which are not JSON-RPC's: ``-32000`` auth required,
  ``-32002`` resource not found, ``-32800`` request cancelled.
* version normalisation. ``protocolVersion`` is a required integer, and a client
  that sends ``"1"`` or ``1.0`` is malformed -- but failing the handshake over a
  type is a worse outcome than reading the intent, and the spec's own guidance
  for initialize is to be tolerant. A version we cannot read at all falls back
  to the latest we support, which is the same answer the spec prescribes for a
  version we do not support.
