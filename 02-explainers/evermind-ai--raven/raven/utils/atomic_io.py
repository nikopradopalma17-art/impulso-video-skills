"""Crash-safe file primitives: locked append, replace, and update.

The helpers serialize cross-process writers with an advisory lock on a
sidecar lock kept in a hidden ``.lock/`` subdir of the target's own parent
(auto-released on process death, so no stale-lock cleanup is needed). The
lock is cross-platform (``portalocker``: POSIX ``fcntl`` + Windows
``LockFileEx``), so concurrent writers are serialized on Windows too.
