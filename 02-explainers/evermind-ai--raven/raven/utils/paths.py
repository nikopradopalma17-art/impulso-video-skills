    ``-srv-work-my-app`` -- separators, dots and underscores alike. Characters

    leading ``-`` is the root slash. Past 200 characters the result is truncated
    and a hash of the whole path appended, which is what keeps long paths apart
    once their tails are cut off.

    The slug is a label, not a reversible encoding, and short paths get no
    disambiguation at all: ``/srv/a_b`` and ``/srv/a/b`` produce the same
    segment, in the reference implementation too. That is safe here only
    because nothing treats the directory name as the project's identity -- the
