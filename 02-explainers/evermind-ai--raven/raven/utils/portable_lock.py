"""Cross-platform advisory file lock.

Serializes cross-process (and cross-thread) writers to a shared file by
taking an exclusive lock on a sibling ``.lock`` anchor via ``portalocker``
(POSIX ``fcntl.flock`` + Windows ``LockFileEx`` under the hood).

Used instead of ``fcntl`` directly, which is POSIX-only: an ``import fcntl``
guarded for Windows degrades to *unlocked* there, and a concurrent write is
then lost rather than serialized.
