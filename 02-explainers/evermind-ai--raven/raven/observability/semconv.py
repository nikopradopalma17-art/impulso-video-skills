    The one number a post-mortem asks first and the record could not answer:
    five calls of about 16.8 MB each came back empty, and the only way to learn
    that was to stat the artifact files -- whose size is not the request's (the
    payload below repeats the system prompt and the latest user message beside
    the full ``messages`` list).

    ``bytes`` is the size of the conversation payload -- ``messages`` plus
    ``tools`` -- as the provider was handed it, serialized here with the wire's
    own compact separators. It is not the request body, and must not be read as
    one: this extractor runs around ``chat_with_retry``, above the provider, and
    the provider then adds the model, the output ceiling, the temperature, its
    reasoning keys, ``stream`` and any routing extras, sanitizes the messages,
    moves prompt-cache breakpoints on its own copies, and on the Anthropic wire
    hoists the system message out of ``messages`` into a ``system`` field
    entirely. So the number can sit either side of the body an operator is
    correlating with a transport failure (measured on one deck-shaped request:
    2,344 bytes here against a 2,490-byte Anthropic body, and 33 of those 2,344
    were separator whitespace the wire never carries -- hence the compact
    separators). What it *is* exact about is its own subject: every byte of the
    payload it names is counted rather than sampled, streamed through
    ``iterencode`` so a 20 MB one is measured without a second copy of it in
    memory (56 ms measured, against a call that takes seconds).

    ``imageBytes`` is *decoded*, the unit the image window's budget is written
    in; the encoded form is inside ``bytes``, 4/3 larger. Recording both is what
    lets the gap between them be seen -- a measured request passed a 12 MB

    than restating its text - the same reference object, so there is no second

    Two rules differ from v1 on purpose. The system field takes the first

    ``request`` and ``generation`` ride along unaddressed. Neither holds
    message content - three integers and the parameters the provider resolved -
