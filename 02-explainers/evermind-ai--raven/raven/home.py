"""Where raven keeps everything.

One environment variable and one default, and no machinery import -- only
the layout paper this module implements (``contracts/path_policy``): it
answers an address, not a question about configuration. It sits in the
kernel set because the kernel has to find its own settings -- a raven-core wheel
that could not locate ``config.json`` without the config shelf would not be the
closure it claims to be -- and because the answer steers the installer, the node
runtime lookup, the trace directory, the cron store and the serve state file
alike, which is more consumers than any one shelf should own.

``raven.config.loader`` re-exports all three names, so the shelves and the
entrances keep reading them from where they always have.

The sub-agent role flag sits here for the same reason: it says whose home a
process answers for (``raven.ops.connections`` reads it to pick the owner's
machine list), so every shelf has to reach it, and this is the one module they
all may import. ``raven.agent.subagent.role`` re-exports it.
