/* The permission gate's approval sheet: why the agent is asking, what it wants
 * to do, and the three answers -- deny, the broader grant the request can
 * carry (a saved rule when the runtime offered one, the conversation
 * otherwise), allow once. An answer that leaves something to do leaves a line
 * behind: a saved rule and its undo, or the news that the engine never took
 * the answer.
 *
 * The sheet element, the answers and the document key handler belong to
 * features/composer/approve.ts; this renders its children, for the reason
 * src/chrome/SheetRack.tsx gives. The wording arrives as props: the opener
 * reads the catalogue once when the request lands, so a language flip does not
 * re-word a question already on screen.
