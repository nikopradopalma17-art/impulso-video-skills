/* The two-pane frame a settings section is drawn in: a list on the left, and
 * what the picked row is on the right.
 *
 * Two domains draw one -- schedules and memory -- and each used to be a
 * module page of its own, where the list ran the width of the window and
 * the detail was a place you navigated TO: a modal over the list, a second
 * screen behind a back button, a drawer sliding in from the right. Inside the
 * settings dialog none of those fit: the dialog is already a layer, and a
 * second one over it is a layer over a layer. So the detail stands beside the
 * list instead, which is also what makes the two readable at once -- picking
 * another schedule is a click rather than a close and a reopen. (Channels were
 * a third, and left the dialog for a page of their own, drawn as cards.)
 *
 * Here rather than in either domain because both draw the same frame,
 * and a class name is shared state: these are `two-pane*`, this file owns them,
 * and the rules are in src/styles/page.css beside the dialog they sit in
 * (scripts/check-class-namespace.mjs reads the ownership off this file's name).
 * What a row HOLDS is still the domain's -- a schedule has a next-run time and
 * a switch, a memory has a date -- so the row below takes
 * those as children and decides only the shape.
