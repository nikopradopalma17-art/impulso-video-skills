"""Custom Hatchling build hook: conditionally package the prebuilt TUI bundle,
the served page, and the agents/ product tree.

The TUI ships as a single self-contained esbuild bundle at ``ui-tui/dist/entry.js``.
We want a wheel to carry it so `pip`/`uv tool install` yields a working
`raven tui` with no source checkout. But ``dist/`` is a build artifact and is
NOT committed (see .gitignore), so a clean checkout legitimately lacks it.

A static ``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]`` entry would make
hatchling hard-fail with "Forced include not found" whenever ``dist/`` is
absent — which would break the ordinary developer flow (`git clone && uv sync`
with no prior `npm run build`). So instead we add the bundle to the wheel's
force-include map *only when it exists*, and emit a warning otherwise.

Release builds run ``npm ci && npm run build`` first (see
.github/workflows/release.yml), so the published wheel always carries the
bundle; dev builds without it simply fall back to the source tree at runtime
(see resolve_dist_entry() in raven/cli/tui_commands.py). That fallback is also
why an editable build carries neither artifact: the checkout it reads is the
one it was built from, so a packaged copy there is dead weight. All three trees
this hook maps are therefore skipped for ``version == "editable"``.

``agents/`` is force-included file by file rather than as one directory,
because a directory entry would ship the working copy rather than the source.
Hatchling applies no ``include`` / ``exclude`` config to a force-included path:
``recurse_forced_files`` drops a hardcoded set of directories (``.venv``,
``.git``, the caches) and nothing else. What sits next to the source in a
working copy is each product's ``.env`` — written by the onboarding wizard and
holding a real provider key. Reading the list from git instead is safe by
construction — the same rule the retired vendored-fork gate applied for the
same reason.
