"""Mechanical quality audit of one deep-research report.

Reads a report as it was delivered - the markdown body plus, when the run wrote one, the
process appendix ``process_appendix.render`` emits - and reports only what a parser can
settle without judgement: which template sections are present, what the trail recorded,
how deep the fetches went, which table cells carry an estimate, whether a ranking agrees
with its own totals, and whether prose leaked in front of the first heading.

Why a script rather than a rubric: the 2026-09-04 head-to-head against a competitor's top
tier lost four dimensions to defects of exactly this kind - an order-of-magnitude number
that entered a scored table as an estimate, a convention table with unfetched rows, a rank
that disagreed with its own total column, and a run whose citations were never opened. Each
is mechanically detectable, so each should be found by a machine before a reader spends an
hour scoring the report. What stays human is everything the audit deliberately does not
score: mechanism depth, insight, whether a recommendation is right.

The audit is vendor-agnostic on purpose. A competitor's report has no appendix and no
ledger, so every trail field degrades to "not recorded" rather than failing - the
estimate, ranking, section and preamble checks read the body alone and work on any
markdown report. That is what makes a head-to-head comparable: both sides are measured by
the same parser.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/research_report_audit.py REPORT.md [REPORT.md ...]
    python3 scripts/research_report_audit.py --json REPORT.md
    python3 scripts/research_report_audit.py --strict REPORT.md   # exit 1 on a hard finding

Hard findings, the three that decided the head-to-head, are the ``--strict`` gate:
an estimate marker inside a quantitative table column, a ranking that contradicts its
totals, and a citation the run never opened.
