"""Give each language its own search index.

The i18n plugin builds the tree once per locale and then writes a single index
covering both, so a reader searching in one language is offered pages in the
other: results they cannot read, behind links that leave the language they
chose.

Splitting that index is not enough by itself. The theme resolves two things
against the `base` recorded in each page -- the index it fetches, and the href
it builds for every result -- so the Chinese pages are pointed one level
shallower, at their own root, and their entries are rewritten relative to it.

The merge lands in a plugin's own `on_post_build`, so the split has to be the
last thing that event does -- hence the priority. Running it on `on_shutdown`
instead looks equivalent and is not: `mkdocs serve` never shuts down, so the
preview would go on serving the merged index however often it rebuilt.
