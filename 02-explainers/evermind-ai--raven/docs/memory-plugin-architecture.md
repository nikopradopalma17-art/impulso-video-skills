# Memory Plugin Architecture & EverOS as a Bundled Backend

> Design record (2026-06, pre-v0.2.0). The bundled-in-tree layout described here was superseded: EverOS now ships as its own distribution under `plugins-dist/everos-memory/` -- see the Plugins entries in `CONTEXT.md` for current terms.

Status legend: **[DONE]** implemented on `feature/integrate-everos` · **[PLAN]** proposed.

This document consolidates the memory subsystem design: the refactored
`MemoryBackend` contract, the plugin discovery model, EverOS shipped as
a built-in (bundled) plugin, how third-party backends integrate, and
the EverOS version-pinning / upgrade procedure.

---

## 1. Goals

1. EverOS works out of the box with no extra install step.
2. Adding a memory backend (first- or third-party) requires **no host
   code change** — drop a manifest + factory, or `uv add` a package.
3. Heavy backend dependencies never slow or break startup: discovery
   reads manifests only and never imports backend code until selected.
4. Behaviour is typed and predictable, with graceful degradation.

Key judgement: the plugin framework under `raven/plugin/` already
provided the machinery (four-source discovery + manifest contract +
typed Protocol). The work was to (a) wire the dormant directory sources
into the live boot and (b) move EverOS in-tree under
`raven/plugin/memory/everos/` — no new mechanism.

---

## 2. The `MemoryBackend` contract **[DONE]**

`raven/contracts/memory.py` defines the single Protocol every
memory plugin implements. The recall surface was refactored from a
single prefixed opaque `owner_id` to explicit XOR track ids:

```python
class MemoryBackend(Protocol):
    async def recall(self, query: str, *,
                     user_id: str | None = None,
                     agent_id: str | None = None,
                     top_k: int) -> list[Memory]: ...
    async def store(self, session_id: str, messages: list[dict]) -> bool: ...
    async def feedback(self, signals: dict) -> None: ...   # may be no-op
    async def start(self) -> None: ...
    async def stop(self) -> None: ...
    async def health(self) -> BackendHealth | None: ...   # doctor + import
```

Contract rules:

- `recall` takes **exactly one** of `user_id` / `agent_id` (XOR). The
  caller knows the track statically: the `# Memory` segment always
  passes `user_id`; `BackendSkillSource` always passes `agent_id`.
  Neither/both set → return `[]`.
- Ids are **bare, backend-native strings** — no `user:` / `agent:`
  prefix parsing. Dual-track backends (EverOS) route the set field to
  the matching store; flat backends (mem0, MemOS) use `user_id` and
  return `[]` for the `agent_id` call.
- Rationale for naming the track explicitly: the prefix convention
  smuggled the host's dual-track concept through an intentionally
  generic field. Each caller already knows its track at construction,
  so the prefix was redundant indirection.

### Identity consistency

`recall` is the read side and `store` is the write side, and they must
agree on identity or stored memory is unretrievable. That is enforced
structurally rather than asked of the user: **`memory.userId` and
`memory.agentId` are the only place either id lives**, and the host
hands both to the backend through `ctx.services`.

| Host config | Reaches the backend as |
|---|---|
| `memory.userId` | `ctx.services.user_id` |
| `memory.agentId` | `ctx.services.agent_id` |

A backend must not read an id from its own `plugins.config[<id>]`
slice. Two places holding the same value is what allowed a user to edit
one of them and split writes from reads, and nothing warned: recall
simply returned nothing forever. The everos backend logs a warning if
those obsolete keys are still present and disagree.

---

## 3. Plugin discovery model **[DONE]**

`raven/plugins/discover.py` scans four sources and deduplicates by
plugin id. Discovery **reads manifests only — it never imports backend
code.** `build_plugin_registry` (`raven/core/plugin_stack.py`) wires
all four via the shared `plugin_discovery_sources()` helper, which the
`raven plugins` CLI command reuses so both see the same set.

### Sources & priority

`Source` doubles as conflict priority (higher wins):

| Priority | Source | Location | Audience |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 4 | `BUNDLED` | `raven/plugin/memory/<id>/` | first-party, ships with raven |
| 3 | `USER` | `~/.raven/plugins/<id>/` | local drop-in |
| 2 | `PROJECT` | `./.raven/plugins/<id>/`, and every root in `plugins.dirs` | per-project |
| 1 | `ENTRY_POINTS` | pip pkg, group `raven.plugins` | third-party distribution |

`bundled > user > project > entry_points` enforces the "builtin shadow
rule": a bundled backend can never be silently shadowed by a same-id
local or pip copy. Different ids never conflict — they coexist as
available contributions; the active one is chosen by `memory.backend`.

### Manifest

Each plugin dir/package ships `raven-plugin.toml`:

```toml
[plugin]
id           = "everos-memory"
version      = "1.0.0"
bundled      = true

[[plugin.contributes.memory_backends]]
name    = "everos"
factory = "raven.plugin.memory.everos.backend:make_backend"
```

### Why manifest-only discovery matters

Discovery parses TOML; it does **not** import the backend. A backend
with a missing heavy dependency (lancedb, mem0ai) therefore cannot
break discovery for every other backend. The factory module is imported
only when `memory.backend` selects that backend — so "ships by default"
never means "pays the import/startup cost by default".

> Caveat: `_scan_entry_points` resolves a package's manifest via
> `importlib.resources.files(pkg)`, which executes that package's
> `__init__.py`. Plugin packages (and the bundled `everos/__init__.py`)
> must stay empty/cheap and must not import their heavy substrate there.

---

## 4. EverOS as a bundled plugin **[DONE]**

The EverOS adapter lives in-tree at `raven/plugin/memory/everos/`,
discovered via the bundled source — no separate package to install.

### 4.1 Layout

```
raven/
  plugin/                         # plugin framework + bundled implementations
    discover.py registry.py …     # framework (unchanged)
    memory/
      __init__.py                 # cheap
      everos/
        __init__.py               # cheap (touched by resource resolution; no heavy import)
        backend.py                # EverosBackend + make_backend
        tools.py                  # understand_media tool
        multimodal.py
        raven-plugin.toml      # manifest (ships as package-data)
```

The bundled memory implementations live **under the existing
`raven/plugin/` package** (not a separate top-level `plugins/`), so
there is a single, unambiguous home for both the framework and the
backends it loads.

### 4.2 What moved, what stays

| Item | Disposition | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `raven_everos` adapter code | **moved** into `raven/plugin/memory/everos/` | thin adapter; no heavy logic enters the host |
| `everos[multimodal]` substrate | **stays** a direct raven dependency | heavy deps stay isolated in the pip package; adapter only delegates |
| `httpx` | stays (already a dep) | http-mode client reuses it |
| `raven_everos` package / uv workspace member / its entry_points | **removed** | code is now built-in; no separate distribution |

Manifest factory path changed from `raven_everos.backend:make_backend`
to `raven.plugin.memory.everos.backend:make_backend`.

### 4.3 Dependency & packaging changes (`pyproject.toml`)

Removed: `raven-everos>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`; `[tool.uv.workspace]`;
`[tool.uv.sources] raven-everos`.

Added to the hatchling wheel include allowlist so bundled manifests
ship in the wheel (hatchling `include` is an explicit allowlist; the
`.toml` is not matched by `raven/**/*.py`):

```toml
[tool.hatch.build]
include = [
    "raven/**/*.py",
    "raven/plugin/**/raven-plugin.toml",
    ...
]
```

Kept: `everos[multimodal]==1.0.0`, `httpx` — the relocated adapter
reuses them, so **no new runtime dependency** was introduced.

### 4.4 Host wiring

`plugin_discovery_sources()` resolves the four source locations; both
`build_plugin_registry` and the `raven plugins` CLI use it:

```python
import raven
return {
    "bundled_dir": Path(raven.__path__[0]) / "plugin" / "memory",
    "user_dir": Path.home() / ".raven" / "plugins",
    "project_dir": Path.cwd() / ".raven" / "plugins",
    "entry_points_group": "raven.plugins",
}
```

Wheel resource path: a normal pip/uv install extracts raven to real
directories, so `raven.__path__[0]` is a usable `Path`. Only
zipimport (running from a `.pyz`) would need
`importlib.resources.as_file` materialization.

### 4.5 User-facing impact

None. Selection stays `memory.backend = "everos"`; config stays under
`plugins.config["everos-memory"]`. EverOS moving from "external plugin"
to "built-in plugin" is transparent.

---

## 5. Adding a new backend (drop-in contract)

A backend is integrated through any of three channels; the contract is
identical: ship `raven-plugin.toml` declaring a `memory_backends`
contribution (name + factory) + a factory returning a `MemoryBackend`.

Two more surfaces are optional. A `[[plugin.contributes.onboard]]` entry
(name + factory returning an `OnboardStep`) gives the backend a screen in
`raven onboard`: the host lends the wizard shell as one `OnboardUI` and
records `memory.backend` from the `StepOutcome` the step returns.
Implementing `MemoryBackend.health()` lets `raven doctor` and `raven
import` diagnose the backend through the contract alone, without the host
importing it ahead of selection.

| Channel | Where | "Install" | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| pip + entry_points (recommended) | standalone package | `uv add <pkg>` | package declares its own (e.g. `mem0ai`) |
| user drop-in | `~/.raven/plugins/<id>/` | copy the dir | user must provide deps |
| project drop-in | `./.raven/plugins/<id>/` | checked into project | user must provide deps |

### Example: a mem0 backend via pip + entry_points

```
raven-mem0/
  pyproject.toml          # [project.entry-points."raven.plugins"] mem0 = "raven_mem0"
  src/raven_mem0/
    __init__.py           # empty/cheap
    backend.py            # make_backend + Mem0Backend(MemoryBackend)
    raven-plugin.toml  # id="mem0-memory", contributes memory_backends name="mem0"
```

```python
class Mem0Backend:  # structurally a MemoryBackend
    async def recall(self, query, *, user_id=None, agent_id=None, top_k):
        if user_id is None:        # flat backend: no agent track
            return []
        hits = self._m.search(query, user_id=user_id, limit=top_k)
        return [Memory(text=h["memory"], score=h.get("score", 0.0),
                       metadata={"id": h.get("id")}) for h in hits["results"]]
    # store / feedback / start / stop ...

def make_backend(ctx) -> MemoryBackend:
    return Mem0Backend(ctx)
```

Install + activate:

```bash
uv add raven-mem0          # mem0ai pulled transitively; entry_points auto-discovered
```
```json
"memory":  { "backend": "mem0", "userId": "user-raven", "memoryTopK": 5 },
"plugins": { "config": { "mem0-memory": { "mem0_config": { "...": "..." } } } }
```

Multiple backends coexist; `memory.backend` picks one; `plugins.disabled`
turns one off. An installed-but-unselected backend's code is never
imported.

---

## 6. Lifecycle & failure semantics

- **Discovery**: cheap, manifest-only.
- **Construction**: lazy — `make_backend(ctx)` runs only for the
  selected backend. `ctx` carries `config` (the `plugins.config` slice),
  `services`, `logger`.
- **Lifecycle**: host calls `start()` once at boot but may not await
  it before the first turn -- `recall` and `store` must tolerate being
  called while `start` is still running -- and calls `stop()` at
  shutdown.
- **Failure contract** (`raven/contracts/memory.py`): a session host --
  the agent loop, the TUI, the gateway, `raven serve` -- wraps every call
  into a backend and treats a raise as the loss of that one call: `recall`
  counts as no hits, `store` as not landed, `start` as no long-term memory
  for this session, `feedback` and `stop` as logged and ignored. `raven
  import` is the deliberate exception: nothing wraps `start` or `stop`
  there, so a raise in either ends the command, and a `store` that raises
  or returns `False` fails that one source and leaves it unsubmitted for a
  retry rather than passing as not landed. A backend that can classify its own
  failures (a timeout is not a refused connection) should catch and act on
  them, because the host cannot.
- **Factory raises**: `maybe_build_memory_backend` catches and falls
  back to no backend (core `MemoryStore` still works).
- **Drop-in dep missing**: that backend's construction fails and is
  skipped; other backends are unaffected.

---

## 7. EverOS version pinning & upgrade SOP

### 7.1 Exact pin is mandatory **[DONE: `everos[multimodal]==1.4.1`]**

The adapter is written against EverOS **internal** APIs, not a stable
public surface:

- `everos.service.search.search`, `everos.service.memorize.memorize`
- `everos.memory.search.dto.SearchRequest`
- `everos.entrypoints.api.app.create_app` (embedded lifespan)
- `everos.memory.extract.parser`, `everos.component.llm.client`
- `everos.config.load_settings`; and for drain in tests/scripts:
  `everos.service.memorize._get_engine`,
  `everos.infra.persistence.sqlite.md_change_state_repo`

Any release — even a patch — can move these symbols. Therefore EverOS
is pinned to an exact version (`==X.Y.Z`), not a range: upgrades are
deliberate, re-validated events, never something `uv lock --upgrade`
can do silently.

Single pin: EverOS is pinned in **one** place, the plugin's own
`plugins-dist/everos-memory/pyproject.toml`. The upgrade surface is one line.

### 7.2 Upgrade procedure

0. **Assess**: read the EverOS changelog; check whether the internal
   symbols above moved, and whether the on-disk schema
   (`~/.everos/.index/` sqlite + lancedb) changed.
1. **Bump the pin (uv only — never hand-edit pyproject/lock)**:
   ```bash
   uv add --package everos-memory 'everos[multimodal]==1.4.1' && uv sync
   ```
   Always keep the `[multimodal]` extra. Skip `1.2.0`: it shipped a
   path-traversal regression fixed in `1.2.1`.
2. **Adapt the adapter** if symbols/signatures changed — only
   `raven/plugin/memory/everos/`. Re-check version assumptions
   written in adapter comments.
3. **Test (all three layers)**:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_everos_plugin_discovery.py tests/test_everos_backend.py \
     tests/test_everos_http_adapter.py tests/test_memory_backend_protocol.py \
     tests/test_memory_backend_contract.py -q          # unit (mock adapter)
   uv run pytest tests/integration/test_everos_backend_e2e.py -m real_llm  # real
   ```
4. **Data migration (major bumps only)**: if the schema changed, real
   `~/.everos/.index/` may need rebuild/migration per the changelog.
   Tests use per-test tmp roots and are unaffected.

   **Migrations can be one-way, and reverting Raven does not undo them.**
   `1.2.1` is the standing example: on its first start it migrates the
   LanceDB schema and prunes older manifest versions, so a machine that
   has run `1.2.1` keeps that on-disk shape after a `git revert` of the
   pin. Rolling back the data means restoring `~/.everos/` from a copy
   taken *before* the upgrade — so take one, and say so in the release
   notes for any bump whose migration behaves this way. An upgrade whose
   only record is a pull-request description is known to whoever read
   that description.
5. **Finalize**: bump the manifest `version`. Two tests assert it as a
   literal and must be updated with it —
   `test_everos_plugin_discovery.py::test_bundled_shadows_lower_priority_source`
   and `test_cli_plugin_commands.py::TestActiveBackend::test_lists_everos_memory`.
   Then commit
   `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` + adapter changes. Rollback =
   `git revert` (plus data restore if the schema changed — see step 4).

### 7.3 Record: `1.2.1` -> `1.2.3`

Four packages moved: `everos`, `everalgo-agent-memory` `0.3.1` ->
`0.4.0`, `everalgo-user-memory` `0.3.2` -> `0.4.0`, and `lancedb`
`0.33.0` -> `0.34.0`.

**No data migration.** No LanceDB table schema changed: `user_profile`
and `knowledge_topic` are byte-identical between the two releases, and
the five files that differ at all (`episode`, `atomic_fact`,
`agent_case`, `agent_skill`, `foresight`) differ only in docstrings. So
the startup schema check that `1.2.2` extended to column *types* does
not fire on an index this upgrade produced. `0.33` and `0.34` were
verified compatible in both directions — each writes Lance file format
`v2.1`, and a table written by either opens, searches (over the other's
IVF and FTS indexes), upserts and prunes under the other — so reverting
the pin can still read the index. Step 4's backup is cheap insurance,
not a precondition.

**The Linux floor moved to glibc 2.28.** `lancedb 0.34.0` ships no
`manylinux_2_17` wheel and no sdist, so CentOS/RHEL 7, Ubuntu 18.04 and
Amazon Linux 2 can no longer install. `install.sh` hands the exported
lockfile to the user's `uv` as constraints, which makes this an
install-time hard failure rather than a slow source build.

**Two behaviour changes.** `extract_foresight` now ships disabled, and
because the default moved in code rather than in `default_ome.toml` an
existing `~/.everos/ome.toml` does not opt out of the change; re-enable
it per install. Agent-skill extraction works for the first time —
before `1.2.3` a cascade race meant it produced zero `SKILL.md` files —
so `BackendSkillSource` starts contributing real skills to the prompt
instead of nothing.

**Two known gaps, not addressed here.** On exhausting a supervised
loop's restart budget the server now `SIGTERM`s itself, expecting a
process supervisor; raven spawns it once per session and
`_SPAWNABLE_STATES` deliberately excludes `FAILED`, so memory stays off
until the session restarts. And `everos cascade rebuild`, now the
supported index recovery, refuses to run while a server holds the OME
lock — while raven exposes no way to stop the server it started.

### 7.4 Record: `1.2.3` -> `1.4.1`

Five packages moved: `everos` `1.2.3` -> `1.4.1`, `pyarrow` `24.0.0` ->
`25.0.1` (EverOS's new floor), `everalgo-boundary` `0.2.0` -> `0.2.1` and
`everalgo-core` `0.4.0` -> `0.3.0` (EverOS now pins its everalgo transitive
layer with `==`, so the resolver follows it down), and `msvc-runtime` joins
on `win32` only. `lancedb` stays at `0.34.0`.

**No adapter change.** Every internal symbol the adapter reaches
(`MemoryRoot`, `episode_repo` / `agent_skill_repo`, `EpisodeWriter` /
`AgentSkillWriter`, the `init_cmd` templates, the multimodal parser and
client, the two error classes) is present in `1.4.1` with the same
signature.

**No data migration.** A copy of a 46 MB store written by `1.2.x` (568
episodes, 5528 atomic facts, seven LanceDB tables at table schema version 2)
started under `1.4.1` with no schema complaint and a healthy cascade. The same
keyword searches returned the same ids in the same order on both versions;
BM25 scores drift in the third decimal place. First start builds an IVF_FLAT
index on any vector column past 2000 rows (`atomic_fact` here) -- seconds, and
searches keep working meanwhile. A real turn through raven then wrote a new
episode into that store and a fresh session recalled it, alongside episodes
written months earlier under `1.2.x`. Rollback was not exercised this time;
`lancedb` did not move, so the file format is the one `1.2.3` already reads.

**A running server from before the upgrade is replaced.** raven used to
reuse whatever answered on the configured port, so an EverOS `1.2.3` left
running kept serving after the pin moved, with every surface green.
`ensure_everos_server` now reads the running server's `/health` version and,
for a root raven owns, sends a mismatch through the same precheck / stop /
spawn chain a rotated credential takes (`stale_reason`). A root the user
manages is theirs to restart. `everos cascade sync`, `cascade fix --apply` and
`cascade rebuild` refuse to run beside a running server (exit code 3).

**Windows.** `1.4.0` runs natively on Windows, so the platform gate raven
carried (`everos_platform_note`, `ServiceState.UNSUPPORTED`, the wizard's
WSL notice) is gone and `_everos_executable` looks for `everos.exe` there.
Spawning, probing and reusing the server were already portable. Identifying
and stopping a stale server was not: `_cmdline_of` asked `ps`, and the marker
`everos server start` never matched a Windows command line, which prints the
executable as `...\Scripts\everos.exe server start`. The command line now
comes from WMI through PowerShell on `win32` and the marker accepts both
shapes; the pidfile raven writes at spawn already named the pid. Verified on
a Windows 11 box: a changed memory role sent the running server through
"holds credentials raven has since changed; restarting", the old pid exited
and the new one answered `/health`. `_listening_port` asks the TCP table
through PowerShell there (no `lsof`, no `/proc`), walking the launcher's
descendants because the socket belongs to the base interpreter two launchers
below `everos.exe`. The stop is Ctrl-Break: the child is spawned in a process
group of its own (`CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, the Windows counterpart of
`start_new_session`, and what keeps a Ctrl-C at the gateway off the server),
uvicorn takes the event as a shutdown, and a server that has not acted on it
in ten seconds -- one another console started, which the event cannot reach
-- gets `TerminateProcess`, the stop every server there had before. Verified
on the same box: a stop from the spawning console runs the full uvicorn
shutdown (`Shutting down` ... `Finished server process`) in three seconds; a
stop from another console falls back and the process is gone in two.

**The upgrade helper sweeps the environment on Windows.** Windows cannot
replace an executable that is running, and the server outlives the gateway
by design, on the environment's own python: with it up, `uv` failed to
replace `Scripts\everos.exe` (`os error 32`). After waiting for the parent,
the helper now stops every process whose executable lives under the tool
environment -- that directory and nothing wider -- and only then installs.
Verified on the box: the same reinstall that failed with the server up
succeeds after the sweep, and the relaunched gateway spawns a fresh server.

**What a six-angle review of the branch then changed.** Each item is a
scenario a real install can reach; the rule behind them is that memory
degrades with a notice and never blocks a turn, a start or an upgrade.

- A gateway starts the server again when it finds nothing listening
  (`EverosBackend._may_respawn` / `_respawn`): only for a root raven owns, only
  when no child of its own still runs, only when nothing holds the OME lock,
  at most once per thirty seconds. Before, the only spawn was in `start()`,
  which a running gateway never passes through again, so a server that went
  away -- an upgrade's sweep, a crash, a stop another process sent -- left the
  gateway without memory until it was restarted by hand.
- A stop that was sent and did not finish (`STILL_DRAINING`: uvicorn closes
  the port at once and finishes the requests it had, an extraction included)
  is no longer adopted by `ensure_everos_server`; it raises, the backend keeps
  probing, and the probe above starts a replacement once the lock is free.
  Adopting it reported memory over a process that no longer answered.
- A command-line lookup that failed (`_cmdline_of` -> `None`: no `ps`,
  PowerShell blocked, WMI wedged, the timeout hit) is distinct from a process
  that is gone. A stop keeps waiting on it; `lock_holder` identifies nothing;
  `restart_for_config_change` reports "could not be identified" instead of
  applied when something still answers on the address.
- A spawn that loses the boot race no longer overwrites the pidfile of the
  live server (`_start_server_if_unlocked`): on Windows the pidfile is the
  only way back to it.
- `stop_pid` counts wall time (each Windows poll launches PowerShell) and takes
  a `grace`; on Windows a backend drains the server it started itself at
  `stop()` (Ctrl-Break, sixty seconds), so an upgrade finds nothing to
  terminate mid-write and a settings change restarts it cleanly.
- The helper's sweep asks again after `Stop-Process` and refuses to run `uv`
  while anything from the environment survives (elevated or another user's
  process): `uv tool install --force` removes the environment before it
  writes, and would have left every file but the one that could not go.
- An embedding pin narrower than the index is measured at backend start
  (`configured_embedding_width`, once per pin per process) and withheld from
  the spawn (`withhold_role`): EverOS runs keyword recall and keeps storing,
  and the notice names the model and the width. The write-time check covers a
  pin written through raven; this covers one written around it. The probe no
  longer raises on an odd response, times out at ten seconds, and an install
  with the plugin on `plugins.disabled` is not gated. `migrate_roles` runs off
  the event loop, which the probe had put a provider round-trip onto.
- The memory page calls the `/api/v2` routes (v1 is EverOS's legacy alias),
  asks `/health` before a search the way the chat adapter does (keyword
  without embedding, the LLM rerank on the agent track without a
  cross-encoder, the profile opted in), and shows the server's own sentence
  on a refusal instead of "unreachable".
- The recalled profile is rendered as lines again: the search response
  arrives as namespaces, and the renderer, handed one, had put
  `namespace(explicit_info=[namespace(...)])` -- evidence fields included --
  into every prompt. A tool-call-only assistant row is stored with empty
  content, not `"None"`; `top_k` is clamped to the server's 1..100; an empty
  query asks nothing; a `/health` probe that failed is not cached as "no
  capabilities" for the life of the adapter.
- The wizard accepts a model wider than 1024 (EverOS keeps the first 1024,
  the settings page already accepted it) and turns the host's refusal into a
  re-prompt rather than a traceback.

**One guard added alongside.** The live install was found pinned to a
768-dimension embedding model against this 1024-wide index, with every store
and search answering 500. `set_embedding_endpoint` now measures the model's
width before writing the pin and refuses anything narrower than
`REQUIRED_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, but only where the config names EverOS as
the memory backend: a knowledge base sizes itself to whatever width the
model returns, so an install with memory off or on another backend keeps
any width. The wizard's own check reads the same constant and probe.

## 8. Validation (this change)

| Layer | Result |
|---|---|
| Unit (everos plugin discovery / backend / http adapter, protocol, contract, plugin command/tools, cli plugin stack, context, config, agent-loop backend dispatch + feedback, agent-loop pipeline) | 240 passed |
| `raven plugins` | everos-memory · Source=`bundled` · Status=`activated` |
| `real_llm` e2e (`test_everos_backend_e2e.py`) | 2 passed, 1 xfailed (best-effort skill-cluster check) — store→extract→recall + dual-track isolation |
| roundtrip script (new import path) | OK; `users/user-raven/user.md` generated |

Known unrelated: the full unit suite cannot run to completion in-process
because `agent -m` calls an unconditional `os._exit(0)`
(`agent_commands.py`, commit 33b4b0d9, to dodge a torch teardown
segfault), which kills the in-process pytest CliRunner. Pre-existing,
independent of this refactor.

## 9. Design decisions & trade-offs

| Decision | Chosen | Rejected | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recall track | explicit `user_id` XOR `agent_id` | prefixed opaque `owner_id` | caller knows track statically; prefix was redundant indirection |
| EverOS code home | bundled in-tree (`raven/plugin/memory/everos/`) | external `raven_everos` package | default-available, single upgrade surface; substrate stays an isolated pip dep |
| Bundled dir location | under existing `raven/plugin/` | separate top-level `raven/plugins/` | one home for framework + backends; avoids singular/plural ambiguity |
| Discovery | manifest-only (TOML) | import-on-scan (Hermes-style) | missing deps can't break discovery; no startup cost for unselected backends |
| EverOS pin | exact `==X.Y.Z` | range `>=,<` | adapter binds internal (non-public) APIs; upgrades must be deliberate |
| Conflict priority | `bundled > user > project > entry_points` | user-overrides-bundled | builtin can't be silently shadowed |
