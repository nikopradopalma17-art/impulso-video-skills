# The page's DataSource seam

Status: accepted (phase P2 of the UI consolidation plan)
Scope: `ui/` only. No wire-protocol change, no server change.

## Problem

The served page is a demo shell that paints fixture data, plus a live layer
that boots afterwards and takes the page over by reassigning bindings it does
not own -- 75 of them by the narrow count taken at the time of writing, which
read only the names the demo shell declares one-per-line; the gate now counts
every binding the live layer writes without owning, and the exact current
number is `node ui/scripts/count-shared-globals.mjs`. Every class
of bug the page is known for -- fixture data flashing before real data, the
double splash, a stale snapshot hijacking a live session -- is a race
between the two writers this structure creates.

## Shape

One seam object, declared before either layer loads, owned by no page:

```
// src/seam/000-datasource.js (loads before demo/ and live/)
const DS = {};            // per-domain sources: DS.cron, DS.sessions, ...
```

There is no second object beside it, and deliberately so: a "real source is
installed" latch would only be readable after the install it is meant to
guard, and the boot order below already makes the question unaskable.

- A domain's **renderer** lives once, in the demo shell, and reads only
  through `DS.<domain>` (list/get/save/delete/subscribe -- the method set
  mirrors the RPC surface the live layer already uses).
- The demo shell **registers** its fixture implementation:
  `DS.cron ??= fixtureCron`. Registration replaces declaration-for-override.
- The live layer **installs** the real implementation before first paint:
  `DS.cron = rpcCron`. Installing a property on the seam is not a shared
  global; the ratchet counts only bare demo bindings the live layer writes.
- Boot order makes this race-free without flags: the assembled script runs
  seam, then demo statements, then live statements, all synchronously,
  BEFORE the load event that triggers the first paint. When live mode is
  active it has already replaced the source by the time anything draws, so
  there is nothing to clear, veil, or repaint.

## The flip recipe (one page per MR)

1. Extract the page's renderer so it reads only `DS.<domain>`.
2. Wrap the page's fixture data as the fixture source; register it.
3. Rewrite the page's live part as the rpc source; install it.
4. Delete the live part's renderer copies and reassignments.
5. Lower the ratchet ceiling by the strands removed, same diff.
6. Verify both modes in a browser (``?stub=1`` and live) before pushing.

## Sources that are watched, not opened

Some pages are not read once when opened; something keeps them fresh while
they are on screen. The subagents panel is the first: a run in flight has to
move without being reopened. That does not need a different seam, only a
clear answer to who owns the watch.

The source stays a plain fetch -- `DS.agents.list(sessionId)` -- and the page
keeps every judgement that is about what is drawn: whether to ask at all,
whether the answer still belongs to the conversation the reader is in, and
whether anything changed enough to repaint. All three are page state, and all
three were living in the live layer, which is why the live layer had to reach
back into the shell and call its renderer.

The watch itself belongs to the live layer, and that is the part worth saying
out loud: it exists because a real server has work in flight. Behind the
fixture source nothing ever changes, so a timer there would ask a question
that cannot have a new answer. A live layer calling a page function to say
"ask again now" is the right direction of travel -- the page owns drawing, and
the live layer owns knowing that something might have moved.

A surface the server does not implement answers with no rows rather than an
error, so the empty state is the page's to word: `rpcAbsent` is what lets it
say "this server does not report delegated work" instead of "no work yet".

## Order of pages

Schedules (cron*) first: 6 strands, self-contained, both sides small.
Then connections (conn*), extensions/plugins, external agents (xa*),
memory, settings, workspace, and last the transcript + session rail
(`SESS`/`cur`, the deepest coupling -- by then the recipe is proven).

## What this does NOT do

- No ES modules yet: parts stay plain concatenated scripts. Import
  bindings are read-only, so modules become mechanical only once the
  ratchet reaches zero -- that conversion closes P2.
- No renderer redesign: pixels and behavior stay as they are; only who
  owns data changes. Any visual change belongs to its own MR.

## Islands (the step after a flip)

Once a page's data goes through DS, its renderer can leave the
concatenated script: a React component in ``ui/src/features/<domain>/``
reads the same ``DS.<domain>`` source and renders into the page's
``#<name>Body``, keeping class names and DOM structure as they are.
Schedules went first (``features/cron/``); its shape is the recipe:

1. Types for the domain's rows and its DS contract (``types.ts``).
2. A plain store outside React (``store.ts``): the shell drives the page
   imperatively (nav opens, Esc closes, a finished turn refreshes, a
   language flip redraws), so state lives where shims can call it and the
   component subscribes.
3. The component (``<Domain>Page.tsx``), classes and structure copied.
   Form inputs stay uncontrolled and mutate the draft in place -- the
   discipline the legacy form kept -- so focus and IME survive typing.
4. The legacy part shrinks to shims (the names external callers use,
   each one line into the island) plus the fixture source, unchanged.
5. Vitest drives the component through the same two seams production
   wires: ``window.RavenShell`` (fake) and ``window.DS`` (fixture).

Two page-wide seams exist for this and grow one line per need:
``window.RavenShell`` (demo/155-bridge.js, late-bound closures so live
rebinds win) and ``window.DS`` (published by the seam part; a separate
script cannot see the page script's lexical scope). The island bundle is
built by Vite as one classic IIFE and inlined by build.py at
``/*__MODERN__*/`` ahead of the page script; check-page.mjs pins the
two-inline-scripts shape so the one-file contract stays enforced.
