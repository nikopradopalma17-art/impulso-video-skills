"""Isolated git-worktree sandbox the driver bash-edits (edit-then-commit design).

The evolution model (SOP §3.1) is "the model edits code freely; robustness via
snapshot/restore + versioning", not diff-application — qwen is unreliable at
writing applyable unified diffs. So a candidate is produced by letting the driver
run ``bash`` in a detached worktree checked out at the PARENT commit, editing any
whitelisted file; we then capture exactly what it changed vs the parent as
``{repo-rel: bytes}``. Those bytes go to ``make_git_commit_apply_fn`` which
commits them onto the parent — giving a real child commit (no RealPathSync, no
live-repo writes; eval checks the commit out into its own worktree).
