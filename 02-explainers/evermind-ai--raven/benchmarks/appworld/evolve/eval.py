"""AppWorld eval + candidate representation for the in-package evolution.

A candidate is the driver's edited harness files (``Candidate.files`` =
``{repo-rel path: bytes}``); ``make_git_commit_apply_fn`` (with ``files_of``)
turns them into a real child commit. Eval then checks that commit out into an
ephemeral worktree and runs ``batch.py`` with ``cwd=worktree`` so the candidate's
committed harness is what imports — no writing into the live repo (the
zero-contamination replacement for RealPathSync).
