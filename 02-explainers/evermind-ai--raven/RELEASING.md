# Releasing Raven

How a new Raven version is cut and published.

## Versioning

- Semantic versioning `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The source of truth is `version` in
  `pyproject.toml`.
- Tags: `vX.Y.Z` for a stable release, `vX.Y.Z-rcN` for a pre-release. The tag
  must match the `pyproject.toml` version -- CI enforces this (`release.yml`).
- For a pre-release, keep `pyproject.toml` at the base version (e.g. `0.1.3`
  while tagging `v0.1.3-rc1`); CI compares only the base. Do NOT set the
  version to `0.1.3-rc1` -- that is not a version hatch will build.

## Release title

`Raven X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` -- for example `Raven 0.1.3 (2026-07-08)`. The CI
draft fills this in automatically (date is the build date; adjust when
publishing if needed).

## Release notes

Notes are hand-written and curated. The CI draft prefills the boilerplate
(Install, Release Status, Notes); a human writes the one-line summary and the
Highlights before publishing. Structure:

```
<one-line summary>

## Highlights
- <user-facing change>

## Install
  install.sh one-liner for Linux / macOS / WSL2
  install.ps1 one-liner for native Windows (plus the PowerShell 5.1 direct URL)
  then: the installer ends on `raven web` (first-run setup is on that page);
  `raven` for the TUI, `raven onboard` to reconfigure

## Upgrade
  raven web --stop, raven upgrade, then raven web once the upgrade has finished,
  with its limits (latest stable unless on the beta channel, plugin wheels
  included, editable checkouts untouched, foreground on POSIX, external helper
  on native Windows)

## Release Status
- Version: `X.Y.Z`
- Tag: `vX.Y.Z`
- Stability: <public preview patch | public preview minor | ...>   # fill by hand per release type
- Assets: wheel, source distribution, the three plugin wheels, locked
  constraints (`raven-constraints.txt`) and the plugin list (`raven-plugins.txt`)

## Notes
- pre-1.0 evolution caveat
- PyPI not enabled; install via the GitHub Release wheel
```

`Stability` is not boilerplate -- set it by release type (patch / minor / rc).

## Flow

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock`, then open a PR; merge to `main`.
2. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
3. CI (`release.yml`) builds the wheel + sdist, exports the locked constraints
   from `uv.lock` (`uv export --locked`, which fails the release if the lock is
   stale vs pyproject), and creates a **draft** GitHub Release with all three
   attached, titled and prefilled from the template.
4. Fill the summary + Highlights in the draft, then click **Publish**.
   Publishing makes it `/releases/latest`, which `install.sh` serves.

While a release is a draft, GitHub addresses it as
`releases/tag/untagged-<hash>` -- even though the tag already exists, since CI
only runs after the tag is pushed. Publishing moves the release to
`releases/tag/vX.Y.Z` and leaves the old URL serving its own stale page with no
redirect. So never share the draft URL: a reader who opens it after publication
sees "untagged" and concludes the tag is missing or the release never went out.
Link `releases/tag/vX.Y.Z` or `/releases/latest` instead; the release job prints
both URLs in its step summary.

## Pre-releases

- `vX.Y.Z-rcN` tags build a draft marked **pre-release**. A pre-release is never
  `/releases/latest`, so `curl | sh` users are unaffected. Use an rc tag to
  verify the release pipeline before cutting the stable tag; delete the rc
  release and tag afterward.

## Notes

- `main` is squash-merge + PR-only. The release itself is not automated past the
  draft: publishing is a deliberate human step.
- PyPI publishing is not wired up; the supported install path is the GitHub
  Release wheel asset resolved by `install.sh`.
- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` pass `raven-constraints.txt` to
  `uv tool install -c`, so a one-click install gets the exact locked versions we
  test rather than re-resolving to the newest allowed by `pyproject.toml`. A
  release older than this asset installs without pinning (the scripts degrade
  gracefully). To lift a pin later, update `uv.lock` and cut a new release; the
  install scripts need no change.
