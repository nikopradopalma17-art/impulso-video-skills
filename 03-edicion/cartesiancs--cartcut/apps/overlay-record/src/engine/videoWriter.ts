/**
 * Capture frames in, an H.264 elementary stream out.
 *
 * This is the piece that decides what a recording looks like, and the whole of
 * it turns on one choice: **the encoder is driven by a fixed-rate clock, not by
 * the capturer.**
 *
 * A desktop capturer is variable-rate by nature — it produces a frame when
 * something on screen changed, and nothing at all while a page of text sits
 * still. Encoding those frames as they arrive gives a stream whose timing lives
 * only in its timestamps, which means a container that can carry them, which
 * means a muxer in this renderer. Encoding on a metronome instead — taking the
 * newest frame each tick and re-encoding the previous one when nothing has
 * changed — gives a stream where frame `n` *is* at `n / fps`, and then the
 * bytes need no timestamps at all: FFmpeg reads them with `-r`, copies them
 * into an MP4 without re-encoding, and the whole muxing problem disappears.
 *
 * It costs almost nothing. A duplicate frame is a P-frame with no residual: a
 * few dozen bytes. And it produces exactly what the editor wants, because the
 * timeline is constant-rate — `features/export/renderTimeline.ts` samples at
 * `frame / fps * 1000`, so a variable-rate source is a thing to be reconciled
 * rather than a thing to be preserved.
 *
 * The other decisions, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 *  - **Hardware H.264, at a level that admits the picture.**
 *    `captureSettings.ts#avcCodecCandidates` computes the level from the frame
 *    size and rate; a hardcoded `avc1.640028` is High at level 4.0 and refuses
 *    anything past 1080p.
 *  - **`latencyMode: "quality"`.** The default is `"realtime"`, which holds the
 *    bitrate flat frame to frame — right for a video call, and wrong here,
 *    where it gives the one frame that scrolled the same bits as the thousand
 *    that did not.
 *  - **A keyframe every two seconds**, counted here because WebCodecs has no
 *    GOP setting. The editor seeks constantly and a GOP is the granularity it
 *    can seek at.
 *  - **`avc: { format: "annexb" }`**, which is what makes the output a bare
 *    elementary stream with its parameter sets inline rather than AVCC needing
 *    an out-of-band `description`.
