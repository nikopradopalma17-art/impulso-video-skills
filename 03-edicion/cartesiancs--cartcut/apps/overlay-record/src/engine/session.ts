/**
 * The recorder's state machine.
 *
 * Everything the recorder decides is decided here: what the tray says, what the
 * capture is configured as, when the encoders start and stop, and what gets
 * handed to the main process at the end. Main is a switchboard — it renders the
 * menu this module builds and writes the bytes this module produces — and the
 * editor hears about a recording exactly once, when there is a finished file.
 *
 * The rules that are easy to get wrong, and where they live:
 *
 *  - **Nothing about the capture may change once it has started.** The encoder
 *    is configured from the size and rate and is already running.
 *    `trayModel.ts` disables those rows; this module never re-reads them
 *    mid-take.
 *  - **A stored device id is a preference, not a guarantee.**
 *    `resolveRecordSelection` maps it onto what is actually present, and both
 *    the menu's ticks and the capture request go through it, so what the menu
 *    says is being recorded is what is being recorded.
 *  - **The camera is composited, never captured twice.** It is drawn into the
 *    same canvas the screen is, on the encoder's own clock, so there is one
 *    encode generation and one file. The overlay window shows the same layout
 *    live and is excluded from capture by `setContentProtection`, so the bubble
 *    appears once.
