/**
 * The "Fx" sidebar tab: effect, transition and LUT presets, in one place.
 *
 * One tab with an internal toggle rather than three sidebar entries. The
 * sidebar is a 2.5rem column that already carries six icons, and all three
 * halves are the same act — picking a preset out of a grid — so splitting them
 * would cost a slot each to save a click. `control-ui-filter` established the
 * pattern of switching panels inside one tab; this follows it, with the
 * difference that every panel here actually exists.
 *
 * LUTs used to sit next to this tab rather than inside it, on the argument that
 * a LUT is a different question — "change how the picture looks" rather than
 * "add an element" — and is reached first rather than last. That is retired:
 * three grids that are browsed identically read better as three toggles than as
 * two icons a user has to learn the difference between, and the column has the
 * slot back.
 *
 * The look is shared rather than owned: the toggle is the inspector's tab
 * track and everything under it is `_browse.scss` over the file browser's
 * tiles, so the three grids read as the same panel the asset list is.
 *
 * The grids are `<fx-preset-browser>`, reused with a different `kind`, and
 * `<lut-browser>`, which is its own component because what a click *does*
 * differs — a LUT grades the selected clips, it does not add an element.
