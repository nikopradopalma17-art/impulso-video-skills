 * selected and creates nothing. The two were briefly both called a pen in the

 * has a rule about.
 *
 * Anything other than `"pointer"` disables playback and the playhead-stepping
 * arrow keys — see `ui/timeline/Timeline.ts` and
 * `elementTimelineCanvas.stepCursor`/`moveSelectionByTrack`. That is the
 * mechanism by which a modal tool does not have to enumerate the bindings it is
