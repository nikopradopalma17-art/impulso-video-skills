/**
 * What is selected on the timeline, and what was last copied from it.
 *
 * Both of these used to be plain fields on `element-timeline-canvas` — the
 * selection a public `targetId`, the clipboard a private one. That worked while
 * the canvas was the only thing that edited, but nothing else could *watch*
 * them: a toolbar cannot grey out "merge" when a plain property changes, and
 * the agent's `select_clips` had to reach through the DOM and then call
 * `drawCanvas()` by hand because writing the field notified no one.
 *
 * They live here so there is one answer to "what is selected", shared by the
 * canvas, the toolbar, and the agent bridge. The canvas keeps its `targetId`
 * name as an accessor onto this store, so the forty-odd call sites inside it —
 * and the two agent commands that reach for it — read exactly as they did.
 *
 * The clipboard is deliberately app-internal and not `navigator.clipboard`:
 * these are live element objects with ids, trims and parent links, not text,
 * and `pasteClips` remaps all of that on the way back in.
