/**
 * The track header column.
 *
 * A row shows its kind's icon rather than its name. It used to print
 * `track.name` — "V1", "A1" — which spent the header's whole width restating
 * something the row's own contents already say, and numbered rows the user
 * cannot address by number anywhere in the UI. The kind is the only part that
 * carried information, so it is drawn as its icon and the ordinal is dropped.
 * `track.name` is untouched: the agent and the MCP tools still name tracks by
 * it. The icon and the tooltip come from `timeline/trackKinds`, which the
 * toolbar's "Add track" menu also reads — a kind is named once, in one place.
 *
 * This used to list *elements* — one row per clip, with an animation-panel
 * toggle each — and it computed its own row positions with a private copy of
 * `index * 30 * 1.2`, matching (or not matching) the three other copies
 * elsewhere. Now it lists tracks, and its geometry comes from the same
 * `TRACK_HEIGHT`/`TRACK_GAP` the canvas lays out with, so the two columns
 * cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Keyframe editing moved to the bottom editor: with many clips per row there is
 * no longer a row belonging to one element to expand.
