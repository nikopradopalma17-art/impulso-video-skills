/**
 * Reading what a media file actually is: size, length, whether it has sound.
 *
 * This is the half of media import that needs a DOM and an IPC round trip, kept
 * apart from `mediaElement.ts` so that module stays testable under vitest's
 * node environment. It is also the seam a test injects at — `MediaProber` is an
 * interface, and `domProber` is only the default.
 *
 * Two differences from the blob-and-callback path the asset panel used to
 * take, through `elementControl.addVideo` and its siblings:
 *
 *  - **No blob.** That code fetched the whole file into memory and minted an
 *    object URL for `element.blob`. Nothing reads `element.blob`: the preview
 *    and both export paths load from `localpath` through `loadedAssetStore`.
 *    So the round trip was a full-file read and a permanently leaked object URL
 *    in exchange for a field nobody consults.
 *  - **Failures are failures.** The originals attached `onloadedmetadata` and
 *    nothing else, so an unreadable file hung the import forever with no error,
 *    and a file that stated no length was placed with `duration: Infinity`.
 *    Every probe here rejects on `error` and on a timeout, and
 *    `measureDurationMs` below is what answers the second case.
