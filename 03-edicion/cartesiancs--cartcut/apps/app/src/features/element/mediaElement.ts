 * The shape of a media element, in one place — and deliberately DOM-free.

 * right for a user clicking an asset and wrong for anything that needs to place
 * several files as one undo step, or to know afterwards what it created.
 *
 * The split here goes one step further than `textElement.ts`'s: the *probe* —
 * reading a file's dimensions, duration and whether it carries sound — needs
 * `<video>`, `<img>` and an IPC call, and lives in `mediaProbe.ts`. What is
 * left is arithmetic on a plain object, which is what makes it testable under
 * vitest's `environment: "node"`.
