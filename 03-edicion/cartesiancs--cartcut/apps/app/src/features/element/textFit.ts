/**
 * Keeping a text clip's box the size of the text in it.
 *
 * `element.height` used to be the line advance, so it was an *input* to the
 * layout: growing the box pushed the lines apart. Now the advance comes from
 * `text/metrics.ts` and the height is a *consequence* — the box a text tool
 * draws around what you typed, which is how every NLE behaves.
 *
 * Nothing else in the app has to know. The selection outline, the hit test, the
 * eight resize grips, the rotation pivot and the Size panel all already read
 * `height`; they simply start getting a number that means what they assume it
 * means.
 *
 * Why this lives in `features/element/` and not `features/timeline/`: measuring
 * text needs a canvas, and the pure ops are deliberately DOM-free so they run
 * under `environment: "node"`. `fittedHeightWith` takes the context so the node
 * suites can hand it a Skia one — the same split `renderer/surface.ts` uses.
 *
 * The fit is best-effort. It runs where layout-affecting edits commit, not on a
 * timer and not from `normalizeDocument` (which runs on every checkpoint and
 * has no canvas). A height that has gone stale costs a slightly wrong selection
 * box and pivot, never a wrong picture — the drawing reads the advance, which
 * is always correct.
