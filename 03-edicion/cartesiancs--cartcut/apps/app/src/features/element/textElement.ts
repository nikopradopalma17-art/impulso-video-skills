/**
 * The shape of a text element, in one place.
 *
 * `ElementControl.addText` used to be the only way to make one, and it both
 * built the element and committed it — one `withCheckpoint` per call. That is
 * right for a user clicking "add text" and wrong for a transcript: forty
 * caption lines became forty undo steps, so undoing "add subtitles" meant
 * pressing Cmd+Z forty times.
 *
 * Splitting construction from commitment lets a batch caller place all forty in
 * a single transform, while `addText` keeps its existing one-shot behaviour by
 * calling this and committing immediately.
