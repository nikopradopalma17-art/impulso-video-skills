/**
 * Baking a text clip into a picture of itself.
 *
 * The half of "render and replace" that needs a browser: an offscreen canvas to
 * draw the glyphs onto, a PNG encode, and an IPC round trip to put the bytes on
 * disk. The document edit that follows is pure and lives in
 * `features/timeline/rasterize.ts`.
 *
 * Three things here are easy to get wrong and expensive to notice later.
 *
 * **Fonts must have landed first.** `renderText` resolves `fontname` as a CSS
 * family; ask before the `@font-face` has loaded and the fallback face gets
 * baked permanently into a PNG, with no later event to fix it up. `text.ts`
 * clears its wrap cache on `loadingdone` for the same reason.
 *
 * **The picture is bigger than the box.** Shadow, glow and outline all paint
 * outside `width`×`height`. Rendering onto a canvas of exactly that size would
 * slice off precisely the effects this feature added, so the canvas grows by
 * `styleBleed` on every side and the image element's origin moves to match.
 *
 * **The bitmap is seeded into the asset cache.** `renderImage` draws nothing at
 * all when `loadedAssetStore` has no entry for a path, and loading is
 * asynchronous — so without seeding, the clip blinks out of existence between
 * the commit and the image finishing its own decode.
 *
 * One thing is deliberately lost: a **frosted background band** bakes as its
 * tint alone. `background.blur` is a backdrop blur, and a PNG of the clip by
 * itself has no backdrop — this canvas is empty, so no backdrop is passed and
 * `renderer/backdrop.ts` declines. Baking the frost would also be wrong: it
 * would freeze whatever happened to be behind the clip at one moment into a
 * picture that then moves independently of it.
