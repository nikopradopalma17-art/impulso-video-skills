/**
 * A whole edit, applied as one undo step.
 *
 * This is the thing neither `video-use` nor Remotion can offer. Both re-render
 * files; Cartcut edits the live timeline the user is watching, and because
 * every op here is a pure `(TimelineDocument) => TimelineDocument`, a plan with
 * forty cuts, twelve captions, six punch-ins and three transitions composes
 * into **one** `withCheckpoint`. A user who dislikes the result gets back to
 * where they were with a single Cmd+Z rather than sixty.
 *
 * That is the whole reason this file exists. Running the same steps through the
 * individual commands would produce the same timeline and sixty history
 * entries, and an agent whose work takes sixty undos to reject may as well not
 * have undo.
 *
 * ## The intelligence is not here
 *
 * Nothing in this file decides what makes a good edit. It has no heuristic for
 * which take is best or where a punch-in belongs, because a model is better at
 * that than any rule I could write, and a rule would quietly override its
 * judgement. What this owns is the mechanics: order the steps so they do not
 * fight each other, mint ids where they must be stable, and put the whole thing
 * behind one checkpoint.
 *
 * ## Order matters, and it is fixed here rather than left to the caller
 *
 * Cuts first, because every later step is addressed in timeline time and a
 * ripple delete moves everything after it. Then motion and appearance on the
 * clips that survived, then things laid on top. A caller that had to know this
 * would get it wrong on the plan where it mattered.
