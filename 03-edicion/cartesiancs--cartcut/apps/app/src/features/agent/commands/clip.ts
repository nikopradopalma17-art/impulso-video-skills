/**
 * Property edits on an existing clip.
 *
 * `update_clip` lived in `text.ts` because text was the only element type with
 * anything worth patching. It never was a text command — it writes position and
 * opacity on every visual clip — and now that shapes, groups and video filters
 * have writable fields too, keeping it there would be actively misleading.
 *
 * What may be written, and why the exclusions are exclusions, is in
 * `writable.ts`.
