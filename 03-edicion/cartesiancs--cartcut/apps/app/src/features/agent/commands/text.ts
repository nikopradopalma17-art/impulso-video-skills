/**
 * Text and subtitle commands.
 *
 * `add_subtitles` is the reason this file is separate from `edit.ts`: it is a
 * batch by design, not by convenience. A transcript arrives as tens of lines,
 * and placing them one at a time would cost tens of round trips, tens of undo
 * steps, and — because each would be committed against a document the previous
 * one already changed — tens of chances for the track chooser to scatter them.
 * Placed together in one transform they land on a single text track, because
 * `placeNewElement` reuses a track whenever the moment on it is free and
 * captions never overlap each other.
