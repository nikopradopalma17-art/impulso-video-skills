/**
 * Transitions and effects, finally reachable.
 *
 * Both have been complete for a long time — a real element type, a full set of
 * ops, repair-on-normalize, the WebGL compositor, and the export path all
 * finished and shipping 37 transition presets and 39 effect presets. What was
 * missing was the agent surface: no tool created one, `FILETYPES` named neither,
 * and `add_track`'s enum had no `"effect"`, so an agent could not even make the
 * row an effect needs. `CLAUDE.md` said transitions did not exist at all, which
 * is how a well-behaved agent came to tell users a cross-dissolve was
 * impossible.
 *
 * So this file is deliberately thin. Every op it calls already exists; nothing
 * here decides anything the editor had not already decided.
 *
 * ## Why a transition is addressed by its cut and not by a time
 *
 * A transition is a **binary operator on two rendered frames**, not an
 * animation on a clip: it needs to know which clip is outgoing and which is
 * incoming. `transitionOps.ts` says so at length. A caller naming a moment
 * would have to be told "there is no cut there" often enough to be annoying, so
 * `add_transition` takes the two clip ids and `list_cuts` is how you find them.
