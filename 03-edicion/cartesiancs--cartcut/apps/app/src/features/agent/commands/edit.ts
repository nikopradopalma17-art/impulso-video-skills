/**
 * Cut-editing commands.
 *
 * Every one of these is a thin adapter: validate what the pure op cannot,
 * translate the agent's vocabulary into the op's, and hand the result to
 * `withCheckpoint`. That is deliberate — routing agent edits through the same
 * `withCheckpoint(pureOp)` path the user's own mouse takes is what makes an AI
 * edit undoable with a single Cmd+Z, and it means these commands inherit the
 * track model's guarantees rather than restating them.
 *
 * The agent speaks in absolute timeline milliseconds. The ops speak in deltas
 * for trims and moves. Converting here rather than exposing deltas is not
 * politeness: an agent that has just read `list_clips` knows where things are,
 * not how far they should travel, and asking it to subtract is asking it to be
 * wrong occasionally.
 *
 * Those absolute times are snapped to frames, exactly as the mouse's are. An
 * agent asking for 1988ms is not asking for something the timeline can express
 * — nothing renders between frames — and letting it through would mean the one
 * path that bypasses the grid is the automated one, quietly reintroducing the
 * off-grid clips the rest of the feature exists to eliminate.
