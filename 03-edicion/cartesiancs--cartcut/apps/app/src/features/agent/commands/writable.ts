/**
 * What `update_clip` is allowed to write, and what it deliberately is not.
 *
 * Whitelisted rather than filtered, and opted in per element type. The fields
 * kept out are not an oversight — each one is either coupled to a second field
 * that has to change with it, or has a consequence beyond the element:
 *
 *  - `startTime` / `duration` / `trim` are bound by the invariants in
 *    `features/timeline/geometry.ts`. `trim_clip` and `move_clips` own timing.
 *  - `speed` divides the timeline span, so writing it resizes the clip and can
 *    overlap its neighbour. `set_clip_speed` checks for that; a blind patch
 *    could not.
 *  - `fontname` / `fontpath` / `fonttype` must agree with each other, and the
 *    family needs an `@font-face` injected or the canvas silently draws in the
 *    fallback. `set_text_font` writes all three and injects the face.
 *  - `filter.list` entries carry a positional `k=v:k=v` string.
 *    `set_video_filters` formats it.
 *  - `trackId` bypasses the collision check that makes `moveClips` atomic.
 *  - `parentId` without a reframe teleports the clip; `set_clip_parent` does
 *    the arithmetic.
 *  - a shape's `shape` point list is unbounded.
 *  - `reveal` cannot seed its own keyframe track. `keyframeOps.isMintableTrack`
 *    covers `intensity`, `fx:*` and `volumeDb` and nothing else, so a raw
 *    `setIn` would leave a clip whose `revealProgress` is advertised by
 *    `animatableProperties` and declined by every keyframe op, in silence. A
 *    path write would also skip `coerceReveal`, storing a `fade: 0` the rule
 *    says to delete, and a leaf path cannot mean "remove the whole field".
 *    `set_text_reveal` owns it, and `apply_typewriter` writes the usual move.
 *
 * `update_clip`'s error message lists the writable paths for the clip at hand,
 * so an agent that guesses wrong is told what it may write instead of being
 * left to guess again.
