/**
 * Projections of the timeline that are safe to hand an agent.
 *
 * Claude Code truncates MCP tool output at 25,000 tokens and warns at 10,000.
 * A `TimelineElement` cannot be sent as-is and stay under that: `animation`
 * carries baked sample arrays of up to `MAX_BAKED_SAMPLES` (36,000) *per lane*,
 * `blob` is an object URL of no use to anything outside this renderer, and a
 * shape's `shape` field is an unbounded point list. One animated clip is enough
 * to blow the budget on its own.
 *
 * So every field here is opted **in**. A whitelist fails closed: a field added
 * to `TimelineElement` later is absent from the agent's view until someone
 * decides it belongs, which is the right default. A blacklist would fail open
 * and quietly start leaking whatever gets added next — `serialize.test.ts`
 * pins that property rather than trusting the reviewer to notice.
