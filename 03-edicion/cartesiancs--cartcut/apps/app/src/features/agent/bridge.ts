/**
 * Renderer end of the MCP bridge: receive a command, run it, answer.
 *
 * Importing this module is what connects the editor to Claude Code; the side
 * effect is the point, which is why `index.ts` imports it for effect only.
 *
 * Every path answers exactly once. A command that throws becomes an error
 * *response*, not an unhandled rejection — the tool layer in main turns that
 * into `isError` content so Claude Code sees what went wrong and can correct
 * itself, rather than watching the call time out with no explanation.
