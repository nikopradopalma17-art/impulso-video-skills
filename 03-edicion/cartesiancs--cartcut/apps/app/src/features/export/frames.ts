 * asking two copies to stay in step is a weaker guarantee than there being one
 * copy. Calling through also picks up `normalizeFps`, so a rate of zero yields

 * ~25 ms once two or more were allowed to overlap — FFmpeg's own consumption
 * is only ~5 ms of it, so most of the gap was the stall, not the encoder.
 *
 * Ordering is safe at any window size because the main-process handler writes
 * to stdin synchronously before it awaits anything, and `invoke` messages are
 * delivered in send order.
