/**
 * The export's progress estimate, and the ticker that keeps it moving.
 *
 * A module singleton rather than state on a component, and it has to be:
 * `finishStream` closes FFmpeg's stdin and returns without waiting, so
 * `requestIPCVideoExport` resolves while FFmpeg is still muxing and the click
 * handler's `finally` runs during the tail. The finalizing phase therefore
 * outlives the function that started the export, and only `PROCESSING_FINISH`
 * in `event.ts` can end it.
 *
 * It used to paint `#progress` and `#remainingTime` inside a Bootstrap modal.
 * That modal is gone — it was also, incidentally, the only thing stopping the
 * user editing during a render — so this now **publishes into `exportStore`**
 * and the title bar's button draws from there. The maths did not move: `eta`,
 * `cost` and `countdown` are reached through exactly the same three calls.
 *
 * The phase lives in the store too, so there is one answer to "is an export
 * running" rather than two that can disagree.
