/**
 * The application menu, run in the renderer.
 *
 * `electron/lib/menuCommands.ts` says what the menu offers and
 * `electron/lib/menu.ts` arranges it; this is the other end of that one IPC
 * channel — an id in, one command run. The ids are checked against that table
 * by `menuCommands.test.ts`, so a menu item with nothing behind it is a failing
 * test rather than a click that does nothing.
 *
 * Every entry below reaches for the same function the keyboard and the toolbar
 * reach for, which is the rule `features/editor/actions.ts` exists to state:
 * the menu item and the shortcut are one code path, and there is no second
 * implementation to drift. Where a command needs a component rather than a
 * store — the preview's zoom, the timeline's playhead — it calls a *public*
 * method on that component rather than restating what the component does.
 *
 * Two guards shape the whole table:
 *
 * - **A keystroke the renderer already binds never arrives here.** Those items
 *   carry `rendererOwnsKey` in the main-process table and send nothing when
 *   they were triggered by their accelerator, because the renderer's own
 *   `keydown` handler is running for the same press. What does arrive is the
 *   click, so the code below must work with no keyboard event in sight.
 * - **The caret wins over the timeline.** Edit → Copy with a caption being
 *   typed means the text, so the six commands that have a text meaning hand
 *   over to the native editing command when `isTypingFocus` says the focus is
 *   a field. That is the half Electron's `cut`/`copy`/`paste` roles used to
 *   serve before these items replaced them.
