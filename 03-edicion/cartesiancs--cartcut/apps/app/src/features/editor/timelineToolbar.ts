/**
 * The edit toolbar above the timeline.
 *
 * It replaced the "Ask me anything" box, which sat in the most valuable strip
 * of space in the window driving a command parser that only ever implemented
 * `ADD TEXT`. What goes there now is the set of things people actually reach
 * for mid-edit — and, for most of them, the *only* way to reach them with a
 * mouse: split, copy, paste and cut were keyboard-only, detach-audio was buried
 * in a right-click menu, and undo/redo had no button at all.
 *
 * Every button calls `features/editor/actions`, which is also what the
 * keyboard handler in `elementTimelineCanvas` calls. This component contributes
 * no editing logic of its own; it decides what to draw and what to grey out,
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * The disabled states come from `capabilities()`, recomputed when the document
 * or the selection changes. They are a courtesy, not a safety net — the pure
 * ops still decline by identity, so a button that is wrongly enabled costs a
 * no-op rather than a bad edit.
 *
 * "Add track" is the one control here that opens a menu rather than acting on
 * the press, because a track has a kind and there is no sensible default: a
 * button that always made a video row would be wrong for the person who came
 * for an audio one, and five buttons would cost the row more space than the
 * rest of the toolbar. It is also the only control that needs no capability —
 * a row can be added to any document, including an empty one.
