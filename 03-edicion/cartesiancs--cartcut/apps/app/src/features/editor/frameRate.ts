/**
 * Changing the project's frame rate.
 *
 * The rate itself is one number in one store, and setting it is one line. What
 * makes this a module is everything that has to move with it, and the fact that
 * three separate surfaces — the settings panel, project load, and the e2e
 * harness — must all move it the same way.
 *
 * Three things follow a rate change:
 *
 *   1. **The zoom ceiling.** It is a frame measurement (`zoom.ts#maxRangeForFps`),
 *      so lowering the rate can leave the timeline zoomed past the end of its own
 *      slider.
 *   2. **The playhead.** It was on a frame boundary of the old grid, which is
 *      almost never a boundary of the new one. Left alone, the preview would
 *      draw an instant that no exported frame corresponds to.
 *   3. **Baked animation.** The baked lanes are a cache read by nearest-sample
 *      lookup, so a 60Hz bake in a 120fps project steps at half rate. See
 *      `keyframes.ts#bakeRateFor`.
 *
 * What does *not* follow is the edit itself. Clips keep their `startTime` and
 * `trim` in milliseconds, exactly as authored — a rate change is a change of
 * grid, not a re-cut. That is what every NLE does, and it is the only choice
 * that cannot lose work: the alternative, re-quantizing every boundary onto the
 * new grid, is destructive and not undoable in a way the user would recognise.
 * Clips off the new grid are pulled onto it the next time they are dragged or
 * trimmed, which is where the user is looking when it happens.
 *
 * The rebake goes through `withCheckpoint`, and `rebakeAnimations` declines by
 * identity — so a project with no animation, or one already baked at this rate,
 * records no undo step at all.
 *
 * **One asymmetry, stated rather than discovered: the rate is outside the undo
 * history.** It lives on `renderOptionStore`, which keeps none, while the lanes
 * this rebakes live in the timeline's, which does. So an undo restores the old
 * bakes into a project the store still says runs at the new rate. It stays
 * coherent because `bakeRateFor` holds a 60Hz floor and the lanes are read by
 * nearest sample, but it is coherent by luck rather than by design. This is
 * also why the settings panel's frame-rate field commits once on release
 * instead of following the pointer: a drag from 30 to 120 is ninety distinct
 * rates, and ninety checkpoints against a fifty-deep stack would evict every
 * edit the user made before touching it. See `features/input/inputScrub.ts`.
 *
 * Lives in `features/editor/` for the reason stated in `actions.ts`:
 * `features/timeline/` is store-free by design, and this reads three stores.
