/**
 * The editor's command surface: one function per thing the user can do to the
 * selection, and one place that decides whether they can do it.
 *
 * Before this, every command lived as a private method on
 * `element-timeline-canvas` and the only way to reach one was a keystroke. That
 * was fine while the keyboard was the only caller. It stops being fine the
 * moment a second surface — a toolbar, a menu — wants the same behaviour,
 * because the second copy is where the two drift apart: one snaps the playhead
 * to a frame and the other does not, one clears the selection after a delete
 * and the other leaves it pointing at clips that no longer exist.
 *
 * So the canvas keeps the parts that genuinely need a canvas (hit-testing,
 * dragging, painting) and hands the editing off to here. The toolbar calls the
 * same functions the keyboard does. There is no third implementation to keep in
 * sync, and no way for the button and the shortcut to disagree.
 *
 * This module is not in `features/timeline/` on purpose: that directory is
 * deliberately DOM-free *and* store-free, holding pure `(doc) => doc`
 * functions that are tested without an app around them. These are the
 * orchestration on top — read the stores, snap to a frame, hand a pure op to
 * `withCheckpoint`.
