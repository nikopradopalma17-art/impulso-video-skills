/**
 * The caption panel's frame clock, and its re-render gate.
 *
 * Two small things that survive from a preview the panel no longer has. It used
 * to run its own animation loop over its own canvas, playing its own copy of
 * the source file; the captions are on the real timeline now and the app's own
 * preview draws them, so the loop went with the canvas.
 *
 * What is left is what the rest of the feature turned out to need anyway:
 *
 * - **`FrameScheduler`**, which is how `captionSession.ts` paces its reveal.
 *   `window.requestAnimationFrame` is reached only through it, so that whole
 *   state machine runs under `environment: "node"` against a counter, the
 *   narrowing `ui/transientModal.ts` does to `bootstrap.Modal`.
 * - **`ChromeGate`**, which decides whether a playhead change is worth a
 *   re-render at all. The panel follows the app's cursor now, which moves at
 *   the display's rate, and the only things in its template that depend on it
 *   are the active line and the active word. Gating on exactly those is what
 *   keeps a 60Hz cursor from rebuilding a TemplateResult for every word of the
 *   transcript sixty times a second.
 *
 * `PreviewLoop` was the third thing here. It is gone, along with the two
 * animation-frame handles whose interaction it existed to pin.
