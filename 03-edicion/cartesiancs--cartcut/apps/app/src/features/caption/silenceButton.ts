/**
 * What the silence button says, when all it has is an icon.
 *
 * It was two labelled buttons in the panel's left column, "remove silence" and
 * "clear". It is one icon in the footer now, beside Apply, which means the
 * words that carried the meaning are gone and the state has to be readable from
 * the glyph, the colour and the tooltip alone.
 *
 * That is exactly the kind of rule that disappears into a Lit template and
 * stops being checkable: `apps/automatic-caption/` is outside every vitest
 * include pattern, so a four-state button written there is a four-state button
 * nothing can assert about. It is here for the same reason `lines.ts`,
 * `editor.ts` and `layout.ts` are.
 *
 * ## It no longer starts the sweep
 *
 * It used to. The gaps were found when the button was pressed and staged until
 * Apply, so the button meant "go and look" the first time and "put them back"
 * afterwards. The session sweeps as soon as the transcript lands now and the
 * cuts are already on the timeline by the time anyone sees this, so the button
 * has exactly one job: turn them off, and turn them on again.
 *
 * Which makes it a real toggle rather than a control that changed meaning under
 * the user, and it is the reason `action` names a destination (`"on"`, `"off"`)
 * rather than a verb.
