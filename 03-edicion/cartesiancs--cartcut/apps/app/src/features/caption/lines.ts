/**
 * Caption lines, and the editor operations on them.
 *
 * The auto-caption panel used to keep two parallel arrays — the recognised
 * words, and the strings the user had typed — with nothing holding them
 * together but a shared index. They drifted immediately: editing a line never
 * reached the words, and splitting *rebuilt every line's text from the words*,
 * so one Enter discarded every correction made so far. The line that would have
 * restored the edit was in the source, commented out.
 *
 * One list fixes that, and one field does most of the work:
 *
 * > **The line owns its span.** `start`/`end` are the line's, not
 * > `words[0].start` and `words.at(-1).end`.
 *
 * That is what makes an edited line, a line split inside a word, and a line
 * whose words were all deleted still have valid timing. Reading the span off
 * the words is what used to throw on `element[0].start` for an empty line the
 * split path had just created.
 *
 * Every operation is pure and **declines by returning its input by identity**,
 * the convention `features/timeline/` states — which is also what lets the
 * panel's undo stack skip a gesture that did nothing.
 *
 * Times are **seconds**, in the source file's own clock, because that is what a
 * transcript timestamps and what the panel's media element counts in.
 * `caption/timing.ts#captionToTimeline` converts to timeline ms at the boundary.

 * Split a line at a caret position in its text.

 * of choosing the time. Counting the whitespace-delimited tokens before the
 * caret gives a word index; when that lands strictly inside the word list, the
 * cut is that word's `start`.
 *
 * A fragment counts as a whole token, so a caret *inside* a word snaps to that
 * word's far edge rather than halving its second. That is deliberate: a caption
 * boundary in the middle of a word is a time that corresponds to nothing
 * audible, and the text the user asked to split at is preserved either way.
 *
 * Only when no boundary is reachable — a single-word line, or text rewritten
 * until it has more tokens than the line has words — does the cut become
 * proportional to the caret's position in the string.
 *
 * Partitioning by midpoint then reduces to `words[0..n)` / `words[n..)` for the
 * boundary case, so the common path is exact and the awkward one degrades
 * rather than throwing. No arrangement of edits can make this fail.
 *
 * Declines when either side would be empty: a caption with no text is not
 * something a user can see or fix, and an editor that silently makes one is
 * worse than one that does nothing.
 *
 * **The head keeps the line's id and the tail takes `newId`.** So a session
 * holding one timeline element per line keeps the element it already placed for
 * the text above the caret, and creates exactly one. Handing the id to the tail
