/**
 * One transcription job, from minting its id to landing its caption lines.
 *
 * The most ordering-sensitive code in the auto-caption panel, and none of it was
 * reachable from a test. Four orderings here look arbitrary and are not; each is
 * stated at the line that depends on it, and each has a case in the suite.
 *
 * `window.electronAPI.req.transcribe` is reached only through `TranscribePort`,
 * so this runs under `environment: "node"` against a fake — the narrowing
 * `ui/transientModal.ts` does to `bootstrap.Modal`, for the same reason. The id
 * minter is injected too, so a test can name the job it is asserting about.
 *
 * ## It returns an outcome; the caller performs it
 *
 * Deliberately. Finishing a job means closing one Bootstrap modal and opening
 * another **in that order, in one tick**, over shared `body.modal-open` state —
 * which is the family of bug `TransientModal` exists for. Those calls stay in the
 * component, in one place, where the order is visible.
