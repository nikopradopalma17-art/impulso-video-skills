/**
 * The tutorial's state machine, as one pure reducer.
 *
 * Time only enters through actions (`satisfied` and `tick` carry `now`), never
 * through a timer of its own. So a "done" flash from a step the user has
 * already left by pressing Next cannot fire into the step after it: the tick
 * that would have ended it finds a state it does not apply to.
 *
 * An action that does not apply returns its input, by identity, the same
 * convention the timeline's pure ops follow. The runner reads that as
 * "nothing happened" and touches nothing.
