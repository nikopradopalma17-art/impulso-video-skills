 * `isMaskActive` has usually already caught, so reaching it here is the second
 * line of the same contract rather than the first.

 * last one. `renderShape` walks its subpaths through here after one `beginPath`
 * of its own, and the default nonzero fill rule turns the reversed inner loop
 * into the hole. Nothing has to ask for `"evenodd"`, which matters because that
