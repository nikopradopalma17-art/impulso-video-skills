/**
 * Round corners, as a rewrite of the node list.
 *
 * One rule decides what is affected, and it is a property of the geometry
 * rather than a list of shape names: **a node with no handles is a corner, and
 * a corner between two straight edges is what gets rounded.** Everything the
 * feature is supposed to do follows from it —
 *
 *  - a rectangle is four corners, so it rounds completely;
 *  - a star is ten, so its points and its notches both soften;
 *  - a heart carries a handle on every node, so it never rounds and there is no
 *    `if (shape === "heart")` anywhere to say so;
 *  - a drawn path rounds exactly the vertices the user *clicked* and leaves the
 *    ones they *dragged* — which is the distinction they were making with the
 *    mouse at the time.
 *
 * The replacement is a cubic, not an arc. `arcTo` and `roundRect` are both
 * exact only under a similarity transform, and this path still has the clip's
 * world matrix ahead of it; a cubic's control points map through an affine
 * matrix to the control points of the transformed cubic, so the rounded corner
 * survives a stretch as the ellipse arc it ought to be.
