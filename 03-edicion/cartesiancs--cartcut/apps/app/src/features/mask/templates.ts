 * `boundsOf` the pen tool uses to frame a drawn path. That is what lets
 * `MaskType.size` mean one thing for all four shapes: 100/100 is the element
 * box, whichever shape is in it, and switching from a rectangle to a star keeps
 * the mask the same size on screen instead of shrinking it by however much
 * empty room a star's circumscribed circle happens to leave.
 *
 * Normalising against the *curve* rather than the control hull matters for the
 * heart specifically: its lobes bulge past their anchors, so hull-normalising
 * would leave it overflowing the box it claims to fill.
 *
 * Authored y-down, matching the canvas and the element's own local space.
