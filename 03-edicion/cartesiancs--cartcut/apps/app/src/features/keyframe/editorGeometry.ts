/**
 * The curve editor's coordinate system, as pure arithmetic.
 *
 * All of this used to live as private methods on the Lit component, which
 * vitest cannot instantiate — the config runs `environment: "node"`, so there
 * is no `HTMLElement` to extend. `features/timeline/layout.ts` and
 * `features/timeline/dragMachine.ts` had already established the shape of the
 * fix: the geometry and the state machine are modules, and the component is a
 * shell that forwards events into them.
 *
 * Two bugs are fixed by the extraction itself, because both were invisible
 * while the forward and inverse maps sat two hundred lines apart:
 *
 * 1. They were not inverses. Drawing went through `millisecondsToPx`, which
 *    clamps a negative result to `0` — one-way, so a keyframe scrolled off the
 *    left edge drew at `x = 0` while its stored time kept running. Dragging
 *    went through `pxToMilliseconds` twice, once for the pointer and once for
 *    the scroll, and that function rounds to whole ms — so the two roundings
 *    compounded and grabbing a keyframe without moving it shifted it.
 *
 * 2. Nothing bounded a drag to the clip. `p[0]` went negative freely while the
 *    drawn dot sat pinned at the left edge by the clamp above, so the point
 *    stopped moving and the data did not.
