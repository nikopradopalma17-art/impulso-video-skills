/**
 * One drag of one keyframe or handle, as a pure transform.
 *
 * The rule the component used to state in a comment and now cannot break:
 * **every frame recomputes from the document as it stood when the drag began**,
 * rather than folding the latest delta into the result of the last frame. The
 * compounding version drifted — each frame's rounding error was carried into
 * the next — and, worse, it re-read an index that `moveKeyframe` re-sorts, so
 * dragging one keyframe past another started moving a different keyframe.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the store. The caller previews the returned document
 * through `previewDocument`, which records no history, and commits once on
 * mouseup through `withCheckpoint`. That is what makes a drag one undo step
 * instead of several hundred.
