/**
 * One undo step per gesture, not per event.
 *
 * `number-input` dispatches `onChange` on every mousemove of a scrub, so a
 * single drag across a spinner emits hundreds of them. Committing each one
 * would push hundreds of entries and evict the whole 50-deep undo stack — the
 * user drags the opacity field once and loses every edit they made before it.
 *
 * So the gesture previews through `previewDocument`, which records nothing, and
 * commits once when it settles: on the next `mouseup`, or after a short idle
 * for input that arrives from the keyboard rather than a drag.
 *
 * This is the same shape the timeline canvas already uses for clip drags —
 * recompute from the document as it was when the gesture began, write to the
 * store exactly once — just triggered by a different kind of event.
