/**
 * The playback-rate dropdown, shared by the video and audio option panels.
 *
 * One component rather than the same row inlined twice, for the reason
 * `controlAudioVolume.ts` gives — and mounted in both panels because *both*
 * element types carry `speed`. An audio clip detached from its video would
 * otherwise be the one clip in the project whose rate the user could not reach.
 *
 * **A `<select>`, not a scrub.** Every other control in this folder edits a
 * property of the picture; this one *resizes the clip on the timeline*, since
 * `spanLength` is `duration / speed`. A `<number-input>` fires `onChange` on
 * every mousemove, so a drag would rewrite every trailing clip on the lane
 * hundreds of times over — and it is mechanically wrong for this range besides:
 * it scrubs at 0.3 units per pixel and snaps to 0.1, so 0.25x is unreachable and
 * the whole 0.25..4 range is about twelve pixels of travel. A discrete pick is
 * one `change`, one `withCheckpoint`, one undo step, and no `GestureCommit`.
 *
 * **Every rate is always offered.** The ripple below shifts each later clip on
 * the lane by exactly the amount this one grew or shrank, so the gap in front of
 * them changes by the same amount and a collision has nowhere to come from —
 * pinned by `speedOps.test.ts`, "never declines for a collision". That is what
 * spares this panel a disabled state, a "no room" hint, and a ripple toggle to
 * explain them.

   * for `speed`. The graph sits directly below showing what is about to go, and

   * is not a rate at all: `coerceSpeed` answers null for it and nothing
