/**
 * The parent picker — After Effects' pick-whip, as a dropdown.
 *
 * The gesture the null object was missing. `groupOps.ts#setParent` has always
 * been able to attach a clip to an existing group, but nothing in the app could
 * ask for it: the timeline's context menu offers only "Group selected" (which
 * makes a *new* group around a selection) and "Remove from group". So a null
 * created empty had no way of ever acquiring a child.
 *
 * **Folded into `default-transform`** rather than added to each panel
 * separately, which is the opposite of the call `controlBlendMode.ts` made and
 * for the opposite reason: a blend mode is meaningless on a group, so it had to
 * stay out of the control a group embeds. A parent is meaningful on *every*
 * element that has a transform at all — including a group, since nulls nest —
 * so the shared control is exactly the right place and the five panels pick it
 * up with no edit of their own.
 *
 * Single-element only, because `default-transform` is. `parentOptions.ts`
 * already answers for a whole selection (`"mixed"` and all), so a future
 * multi-select panel needs nothing new here.
