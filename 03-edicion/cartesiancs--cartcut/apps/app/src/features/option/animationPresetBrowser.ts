/**
 * The animation preset grid, in a clip's inspector.
 *
 * Deliberately shaped like `fx/fxPresetBrowser.ts` and `lut/lutBrowser.ts` —
 * the same `.asset` tile, the same uppercase category headings, the same single
 * rAF loop that animates only the tile under the pointer — because a third grid
 * that browses alike should look alike. What differs is what a tile draws and
 * what a click does.
 *
 * **A click applies the preset at the playhead**, to every selected clip, as
 * one undo step. That is the After Effects arrangement rather than Premiere's:
 * the preset is a move, and where the move happens is wherever the user has
 * parked the cursor. `presets.ts#playheadAnchor` decides whether the playhead
 * is over a given clip at all; when it is not, the preset falls back to its own
 * anchor — the clip's start, or its end for an out preset — because a tile that
 * silently does nothing is the worst outcome a grid like this can have.
 *
 * ## The tiles show the real move
 *
 * Each thumbnail is drawn from `animation/presetPreview.ts#previewSamples`,
 * which runs the *actual* `applyPreset` and reads it back through the *actual*
 * `localSampleAt`. Nothing here restates what a preset does, so nothing here
 * can be edited into disagreeing with it. The same argument `fxPreviewProvider`
 * makes for rendering its thumbnails through the real compositor.
 *
 * Two things about the drawing that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * - **The resting frame is step 0 with opacity ignored.** Step 0 is the pose a
 *   preset starts from, which is what makes Move Up sit low in its tile and
 *   Move Down sit high — the grid reads as a diagram before anything is
 *   hovered. Honouring opacity there would render `fade_in` as an empty square,
 *   so the resting frame shows the *pose* and the hover shows the *motion*.
 * - **Only "None" gets an active outline.** Unlike a LUT, an applied preset
 *   leaves no mark on the document: its keyframes are indistinguishable from
 *   ones drawn by hand. A highlight on Fade In would be a guess presented as a
 *   fact, so there is none, and "None" lights up on the one thing that *is*
 *   knowable — that the clip has no animation at all.
 *
 * Strings are English and stay English, following `fxPresetBrowser`,
 * `lutBrowser` and `ControlText`.
