/**
 * The keyframe diamond, as every other NLE draws one.
 *
 * What it replaces was a two-state boolean: lit when
 * `animation[property].isActivate` was true, dim otherwise, and a click toggled
 * the track. That is the *stopwatch's* question. A diamond answers a different
 * one — **is there a keyframe on the frame I am looking at** — and clicking it
 * puts one there or takes it away. The sidebar had no way to do either; the
 * only route was the curve editor behind a right-click.
 *
 * Nine hand-written copies of that button existed across three files (four
 * inlined in `controlDefaultTransform`, five in the mask section, one in the
 * reveal section), which is why this is a component rather than a fourth copy.
 *
 * ## CapCut's arrangement, deliberately
 *
 * There is no separate stopwatch. One control carries all three states, and
 * `toggleKeyframe` decides which is which:
 *
 *   not armed        hollow, dim     -> arm, and plant one here
 *   armed, no key    hollow, bright  -> plant one here
 *   armed, key here  FILLED, bright  -> remove it; the last one disarms
 *
 * The filled/hollow pair comes free from the icon font: `style.scss` sets
 * `FILL 1` on every Material Symbol globally, and Material Symbols is a
 * variable font, so restating the axes with `FILL 0` gives the outline. No new
 * glyph, no SVG, and nothing fetched — the font is already bundled for offline.
 *
 * ## It reads the store rather than taking props
 *
 * `controlDefaultTransform` has `timelineCursor` prop-drilled through six
 * panels. Subscribing here instead — the mask and reveal sections' newer
 * pattern, with real teardown — is what lets one element drop into all three
 * without each host learning to feed it.
