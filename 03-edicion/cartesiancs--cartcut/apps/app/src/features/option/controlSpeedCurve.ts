/**
 * The speed ramp's graph, in the video and audio option panels.
 *
 * A thin shell: every rule lives in `features/speed/curveGraph.ts`, which is
 * node-tested, and every write goes through `speedOps.ts#setClipSpeedCurve`.
 * What is left here is a canvas, four pointer handlers and the preset row.
 *
 * **The x axis is source time**, which is what makes direct manipulation
 * possible at all. Editing a ramp changes how long the clip is, so a graph
 * drawn against timeline time would resize under the pointer on the frame the
 * drag committed and the position being dragged would name a different instant
 * each repaint. `curveGraph.ts` says the same at more length.
 *
 * The ramp is also drawn over the clip in the timeline (`speedBand.ts`), and
 * that copy is **draw-only** for the same reason: `layout.ts#hitTest` never
 * offers it, so no press can land on a band whose clip is about to resize.
 *
 * ## The toggle arms the section; it does not write a ramp
 *
 * A clip that carries a ramp reads as on, and on top of that the panel holds a
 * local flag the switch writes. Flipping it on shows the graph as the flat line
 * the clip is already playing and stores **nothing**: `coerceSpeedCurve` answers
 * `null` for a flat curve, so `setClipSpeedCurve` declines and the clip neither
 * resizes nor ripples its lane until a point actually moves. A toggle that
 * seeded a real ramp would change how the clip plays as the price of looking at
 * it.
 *
 * The flag is deliberately not a field on the element. It would be UI state in
 * the project file, and an armed-but-flat ramp would save a key for nothing,
 * against the rule that a feature nobody has used saves byte-identically. What
 * it costs is that arming does not survive selecting away and back, which is
 * the right trade: if there is a ramp, the document says so; if there is not,
 * there is nothing to remember. `timelineLockStore` is ephemeral on the same
 * argument.
 *
 * Switching it **off** removes the ramp and leaves `speed` at the mean it was
 * running, so the clip keeps its length and its neighbours do not move. No
 * confirm: the graph above it showed what was there, and undo is one keystroke.
