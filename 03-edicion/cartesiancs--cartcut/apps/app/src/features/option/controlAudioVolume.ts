/**
 * The level fader, shared by the audio and video option panels.
 *
 * One component rather than the same row inlined twice: the markup, the
 * clamping handler, the read-back and the store subscription are identical for
 * both panels, and the read-back is the fiddly half — the place two copies
 * would quietly drift apart. `default-transform` is the precedent for exactly
 * this shape.
 *
 * The note that used to be here said a level was not animatable and that this
 * control therefore needed no cursor. It is, and it does: the field shows the
 * level at the playhead through `volumeDbAt`, and a scrub with the stopwatch
 * armed writes a keyframe there rather than a static value. The rest of the
 * arrangement is unchanged.
 *
 * Still narrower than `default-transform` in one way: **no `timeline` /
 * `timelineState` props.** This reads the store directly.
 * `default-transform` reads a `timeline` its *parent* refreshes from a
 * separately-registered zustand subscriber, which works only because the parent
 * happens to have subscribed first; there is no reason to inherit that ordering
 * dependency for one number.
