/**
 * The blend-mode dropdown, shared by every option panel whose clip is painted
 * as a layer.
 *
 * One component rather than the same `<select>` inlined into four panels, for
 * the reason `controlAudioVolume.ts` gives: the markup, the grouped option list
 * and the read-back are identical, and the read-back is the half two copies
 * would drift on.
 *
 * **Not** folded into `default-transform`, which would have been fewer edits.
 * That control is also embedded by `optionGroupElement.ts`, and a group paints
 * nothing — it exists only to hold a transform for its children. Offering a
 * blend mode there would be a control that does nothing, on the one element
 * type whose type does not even carry the field.
