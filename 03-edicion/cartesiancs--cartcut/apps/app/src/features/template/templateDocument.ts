/**
 * Turning an installed `template.ngt` into the `TemplateData` the renderer uses.
 *
 * A `.cttpl` holds a real `.ngt`, so this reads one the same way
 * `functions/project.ts#load` does — and reuses the same
 * `features/project/assetsFile.ts#relinkAssets` to resolve the relative paths
 * inside it against the folder it was extracted into. That reuse is the whole
 * reason the format needed almost no new path code: a template folder and a
 * portable project folder are the same problem, and it was already solved.
 *
 * Everything with an effect on disk is a parameter — the JSON entries arrive as
 * strings and `exists` is injected — so this runs in the `node` suite and the
 * registry above it is left holding nothing but IO and a state machine.
 *
 * **The version gate is a compatibility check, not a migrator**, exactly as it
 * is for a project: a `template.ngt` from a different `SCHEMA_VERSION` is
 * refused with a message rather than guessed at. What it is *not* is a reason
 * to refuse the archive at install time — a template that cannot be read is a
 * template that draws nothing, which is the contract the registry states.
