/**
 * Per-range text style: what one stretch of a text element overrides about the
 * clip it sits in, and how a stored list of those survives being read, written
 * and edited.
 *
 * The module follows the split the rest of the codebase uses:
 *
 *  - **`runsOf` guards reads.** It runs inside the layout, once per element per
 *    frame, and must never throw. Whatever is in the file, it answers a sorted,
 *    disjoint, non-empty list clamped to the string that is actually there.
 *  - **`coerceRunStyle` validates writes.** It runs once, where a value arrives
 *    from the panel, and drops a field it cannot read rather than defaulting
 *    it. Past that point an unusable override is unrepresentable.
 *
 * Two things are worth knowing before changing anything here.
 *
 * **Offsets are UTF-16 code units, and that is not a choice.**
 * `textarea.selectionStart` is measured that way and its value is what lands in
 * a run. `runsOf` snaps an offset that falls inside a surrogate pair outward,
 * so no consumer can `slice` out a lone surrogate.
 *
 * **A style with no keys is not a style.** The whole default-deletes-the-key
 * rule rests on it: `applyRunStyle` answers "paint this range the colour it
 * already is" by producing an empty style, which is then dropped, which leaves
 * no runs, which lets `timeline/textRunOps.ts` delete the field and save the
 * project byte-identically to one written before the feature existed.
 *
 * Deliberately DOM-free and store-free, like `style.ts` and `metrics.ts`: it
 * runs under `environment: "node"` and the pure ops import it.
