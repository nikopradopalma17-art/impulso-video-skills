/**
 * Turning a horizontal drag into a number.
 *
 * The arithmetic of a Figma-style scrub, with no DOM in it — the pointer lock,
 * the listeners and the cursor all live in `scrubSession.ts`. Keeping the sums
 * here is what lets them be tested under `environment: "node"`, the same rule
 * `features/timeline/` follows.
 *
 * Three decisions carry the whole module, and each is load-bearing:
 *
 * - **The accumulator is in value space, not pixel space.** `raw` is advanced by
 *   `movementX * sensitivity * factor` on every event. Accumulating *pixels* and
 *   multiplying at the end would mean that pressing Shift halfway through a drag
 *   retroactively rescales the distance already travelled, and the number jumps.
 *
 * - **`raw` itself is clamped, not just the value read out of it.** Clamping only
 *   on the way out lets the accumulator wind up: drag 500px past the maximum and
 *   you must drag 500px back before the number moves at all.
 *
 * - **Crossing the threshold spends the threshold.** The travel that recognised
 *   the drag is subtracted, so the value at the instant of engagement is exactly
 *   the value the field started with. That also quietly absorbs a second
 *   discontinuity: before the lock `movementX` is a CSS-pixel screen delta and
 *   after it is an OS-accelerated device delta, and the scale changes at the one
 *   moment when nothing has moved yet.
