/**
 * Changing a clip's playback rate.
 *
 * Speed sits between the two invariants `geometry.ts` states, and only one of
 * them mentions it:
 *
 *  - `duration === trim.endTime - trim.startTime`, in **source** ms. `speed`
 *    does not appear, so changing it cannot break `assertTrimInvariant`. None
 *    of the footage is gained or lost.
 *  - the clip occupies `[startTime, startTime + duration/speed)` on the
 *    **timeline**. `speed` is the divisor, so changing it *resizes the clip
 *    where it sits*.
 *
 * That second one is why this is not a field `update_clip` may write. Halving
 * the speed of a ten-second clip makes it occupy twenty and overlap whatever
 * is next to it — and "clips on a track never overlap" is the one rule every
 * other op in `clipOps.ts` checks with `findCollisions` and declines on.
 * `update_clip` has no collision check and no ripple, and bolting one onto a
 * generic property patcher would make its contract incoherent.
 *
 * Keyframes are deliberately left at their own times. They are stored in
 * timeline ms relative to the clip's start, so speeding a clip up leaves its
 * animation running past the new end. Rescaling them is a defensible choice
 * and so is not rescaling them; there is no UI precedent either way, and
 * silently rewriting curves the user authored is the worse failure. The tool
 * description says which one this is.
