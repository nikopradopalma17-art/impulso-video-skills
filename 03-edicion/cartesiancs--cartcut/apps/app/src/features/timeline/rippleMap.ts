/**
 * Where a time ends up once a set of ranges has been rippled out of a lane.
 *
 * `removeRanges(doc, id, cuts, ripple: true, …)` leaves the surviving footage
 * contiguous: each cut is split out and everything after it on that track slides
 * back by the cut's length. So a caller who knows the cut list can say where any
 * time went without looking at the document at all, which is what this module
 * is for.
 *
 * That matters because after the cut the original clip is **N pieces with new
 * ids**, and the one id the caller started with names only the first of them.
 * Anything holding a source-file time, a transcript above all, would otherwise
 * have to re-find which piece now covers it. The arithmetic here is the same
 * answer, reached without the search:
 *
 * > `t' = t - removedBefore(t)`, and a span also loses whatever was cut *inside*
 * > it.
 *
 * ## The one thing that makes it true
 *
 * The prediction and the edit have to be driven by the **same list**. `onFrame`
 * snapping can collapse a range onto a single frame, and `removeRanges` skips a
 * range whose clamped width is zero, so a caller that snaps after predicting
 * gets a different answer from the one the document got. Snap and normalise
 * once, then hand the same array to both.
 *
 * Order-agnostic on purpose: `normalizeRanges` returns its ranges **descending**
 * because that is what makes the cuts land in un-moved coordinates, and nothing
 * here should quietly depend on that. Disjointness is what these sums need, and
 * `normalizeRanges` is what guarantees it.
 *
 * Times are timeline milliseconds throughout. No DOM, no store: this runs under
 * `environment: "node"`.

 * against the grown value.

 * not one this editor has anywhere else". So a detached audio twin, a music bed,
 * a title or a caption placed earlier keeps its old timing while the picture
 * under it gets shorter, and nothing repairs that.
 *
 * This is what lets a caller say so before committing, rather than leaving it to
 * be discovered on playback. **Text tracks are included**: a caption from a
 * previous pass is the single most likely thing to be sitting over the cuts, and
 * excluding it would leave the warning silent in the commonest case.
 *
 * Deliberately cheap and deliberately about *time*, not about audibility. A clip
 * that merely overlaps a cut is worth naming whether or not the user would
 * notice, for the same reason `add_subtitles` reports what is stacked over a
 * caption rather than trying to decide whether the pixels are covered.
