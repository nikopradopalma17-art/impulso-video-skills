/**
 * Element transforms, as matrices.
 *
 * This is the single definition of where an element sits. `applyElementTransform`
 * in `features/renderer/element.ts` used to *be* that definition, expressed as a
 * sequence of `ctx.translate/rotate/scale` calls — which meant nothing else could
 * ask the question without reimplementing it. `previewCanvas.collisionCheck` did
 * reimplement it, by hand, for rotation only; the header of
 * `features/preview/elementPosition.ts` documents what that divergence cost.
 *
 * So the ctx sequence moved here and became a matrix, and the renderer became a
 * one-line wrapper around it. Drawing and hit-testing can no longer disagree,
 * because they cannot ask separately.
 *
 * The second thing this file adds is the parent chain. A child's `location` and
 * its `position` keyframes are coordinates **in its parent's space**, so the
 * matrix that puts it on the canvas is the product of every ancestor's matrix
 * with its own. That is the whole of the group feature: move a group and its
 * children follow, with not one keyframe rewritten.
