/**
 * Grouping, ungrouping and re-parenting, as pure document transforms.
 *
 * The contract every op here keeps, and the reason they are pure: an op that
 * declines returns **the document it was given, by identity**.
 * `useTimelineStore.withCheckpoint` reads that as "nothing happened" and
 * records no undo step, so a refused group costs the user nothing.
 *
 * ## The one invariant that matters
 *
 * **Grouping must not move anything.** A user who selects two clips and presses
 * Group expects the picture to be identical the instant after. Since a child's
 * `location` is thereafter read in the group's space, keeping the picture still
 * means rewriting each child's position by the inverse of the group's
 * transform.
 *
 * That rewrite is only *exact* for a translation. A general affine would have to
 * push a rotation through the two position lanes, and the lanes carry
 * independent bezier handle abscissae — x(t) and y(t) are separately
 * parameterised curves, so a transform mixing one into the other has no exact
 * representation in this data model.
 *
 * So `createGroup` never needs one: it seats the new group at the selection's
 * bounding box with no rotation and unit scale, which makes the compensation it
 * owes each child exactly `−bbox.topLeft`. A translation. Exact, for the static
 * value and for every keyframe and handle on the curve.
 *
 * `ungroup` and `setParent` can face a rotated or scaled group, and there the
 * anchors are still exact while the handles are carried through the same linear
 * map — the easing between keyframes can bow slightly. `groupOps.test.ts` pins
 * the anchor exactness and marks the boundary.
