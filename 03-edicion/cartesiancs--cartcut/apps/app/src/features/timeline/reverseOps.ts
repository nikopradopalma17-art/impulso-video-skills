/**
 * Reversing a video clip, as a pair of document edits.
 *
 * The slow half — making a file of the clip's window played backwards — is
 * `electron/lib/reverse.ts`, driven by `features/reverse/reverseSession.ts`.
 * What lives here is the instant half: pointing the clip at that file, and
 * pointing it back.
 *
 * **The clip's `localpath` is swapped for the reversed file.** That is the
 * whole design, and it is why nothing downstream needed to change: the preview
 * decodes `localpath`, the export's audio reads `-i localpath`, the filmstrip
 * and the waveform key on `localpath`, and `loadedAssetStore` drops a decoder
 * whose path changed. A `reversed: true` flag that every one of those had to
 * consult would have been six features' worth of edits, and the one anybody
 * forgot would play forwards in silence.
 *
 * The reversed file covers exactly the clip's trim window `[from, to]`, so the
 * clip becomes `trim = [0, duration]` over it and **its timeline span does not
 * change** — nothing next to it moves. The original is remembered in
 * `reversed`, and a source time `r` in the new file is `to - r` in the old one.
 * That mapping is what makes `unreverse` exact, instant, and correct after the
 * reversed clip has been split or trimmed inside its window.
 *
 * Keyframes, transitions, speed, blend, grade, mask and mirror are left alone.
 * They are all in timeline time or are properties of the picture; reversal is
 * a property of the media.
