/**
 * The single source of truth for timeline geometry.
 *
 * Before this module the codebase held three incompatible readings of `trim`:
 *
 *   A. the canvas compositor (`renderer/video.ts`, `element/time.ts`) treated a
 *      clip as `[startTime, startTime + duration/speed)` and ignored `trim`,
 *      documenting it as an FFmpeg `-ss` offset;
 *   B. the timeline UI and the FFmpeg audio path treated it as
 *      `[startTime + trim.startTime, startTime + trim.endTime)`;
 *   C. `loadedAssetStore.seek` ignored `trim` altogether when seeking the
 *      `<video>`, so a trimmed clip previewed the wrong source frame.
 *
 * Reading A wins, and it is now an invariant rather than a convention:
 *
 *   - `trim` is a window into the **source file**, measured in source ms.
 *   - `duration` is that window's length, so
 *     `duration === trim.endTime - trim.startTime` for dynamic elements.
 *   - the clip occupies `[startTime, startTime + duration/speed)` on the
 *     timeline, which is the same shape static elements already had.
 *
 * Keeping both readings straight is what makes a Final Cut style split work:
 * the two halves differ in `trim` *and* in `startTime`/`duration`, so they land
 * side by side instead of on top of each other.
