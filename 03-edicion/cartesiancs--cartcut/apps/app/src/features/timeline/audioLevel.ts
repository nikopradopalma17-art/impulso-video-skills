/**
 * How loud the project is at the playhead.
 *
 * The preview mixes nothing: `syncPlayback` hands N independent
 * `HTMLMediaElement`s their `volume` and lets the OS mixer add them up, so
 * there is no master bus in the renderer to tap. Rather than build one, the
 * level is *derived* from the same two things the preview itself reads: the
 * decoded waveform of each file and the clip's own level.
 *
 * The argument against building one still stands, and `asset/audioGraph.ts`
 * shows what it costs where a graph genuinely is needed:
 * `createMediaElementSource` can be called once per handle, cannot be undone,
 * silences the clip if the graph is ever left unconnected, and cannot be
 * reached by a suite in a repo with no DOM test environment. That module takes
 * on all of it for one reason a meter does not have, playing a clip above
 * unity, and it attaches only to the handles that actually need it. A master
 * bus would have taken it on for every clip in every project.
 *
 * That makes it pure and node-testable — it answers for a cursor rather than
 * for a moment, so a suite can ask it about the middle of a clip without a
 * clock, a decoder or a speaker.
 *
 * It says what *would* be heard at a cursor, not what is. Whether that is the
 * same thing is the caller's question: `previewBottomBar` asks only while
 * `isPlay`, because `playback.ts#intentFor` gives a handle
 * `playing: isPlaying && inWindow` and a scrub therefore moves the playhead
 * over a clip in silence.
 *
 * Audibility is asked of `audio.ts#isAudibleElement`, the *same function*
 * `playback.ts#intentFor` uses to decide `muted`. The meter and the sound
 * therefore cannot disagree about which clips are contributing — a detached
 * video's picture handle is excluded here for exactly the reason it is silenced
 * there.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free.
