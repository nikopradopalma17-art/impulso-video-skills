 * Every clip a rubber-band touches, in layout order.
 *
 * The area query to `hitTest`'s point query, and it lives here for the reason
 * this module exists: both read `layout.clips` and both have to agree about
 * where a clip ends. `hitTest` writes that as `x >= clip.x + clip.w`; the test
 * below is the same half-open rule on both axes, which is also
 * `overlap.ts#overlaps` in two dimensions. Split across two files, a click and
 * a one-pixel band on the same pixel could name different clips.
 *
 * Three consequences follow from the half-open rule, and each matches something
 * the codebase already states:
 *
 * - A band with no width or no height selects nothing — `overlaps`' own rule,
 *   that a zero-width interval contains no instant. The gesture never presents
 *   one (a band does not start until the pointer has travelled), so this is
 *   about the function being total rather than about the UI.
 * - A band whose right edge lands exactly on a clip's left edge misses it, and
 *   one that *starts* there hits it. That is the rule `hitTest` gives abutting
 *   clips: an edge belongs to exactly one side.
 * - Touching is enough, and so is being contained: the test asks only whether
 *   two boxes overlap, so a band drawn wholly inside a long clip selects it.
 *
 * Iterating `layout.clips` in its natural order — track index, then start time,
 * then id — makes the result independent of which way the band was dragged.
 * That is what lets `selectionStore.setIds` decline a mousemove that swept
 * nothing new, which is the whole reason a band can update the selection live.
 *
 * Taking a `TimelineLayout` rather than a `TimelineDocument` is deliberate:
 * `layout.clips` is viewport-culled and clamped to `MIN_CLIP_PX`, so the band
 * selects exactly what is *drawn*, down to a clip too short to draw at its true
 * width. Re-deriving from the document would reintroduce the drift this module
 * exists to prevent.
