/**
 * Waveform geometry: which slice of a decoded audio file each pixel column

 *
 * The filmstrip's problem in a different shape. Decoding audio is expensive and
 * happens once per file; what changes constantly is how much source time a
 * single pixel covers. So the decode produces a fixed bucket array — min and
 * max amplitude over a small slice of source — and drawing folds however many
 * buckets a column spans into one min/max pair.
 *
 * Min *and* max rather than a single magnitude: a waveform drawn from
 * magnitude alone loses the asymmetry that makes speech and music legible.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free.
