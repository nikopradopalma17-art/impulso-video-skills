/**
 * Which frames a clip's filmstrip needs, and where each one goes.
 *
 * All of the awkwardness here comes from one constraint: decoding a frame costs
 * tens of milliseconds, and the timeline redraws on every scroll, zoom and
 * drag. So the tile a given pixel wants must be **stable** — if it changed
 * continuously with zoom, every frame of a zoom gesture would miss the cache and
 * queue a fresh decode that arrives too late to be used.
 *
 * Quantising the source position fixes that. A tile addresses a rounded instant
 * in the source file rather than an exact one, so panning a few pixels or
 * nudging the zoom keeps asking for the same handful of frames.
 *
 * This module is pure: no decoder, no canvas, no DOM. It is where the real
 * coverage lives.

/**
 * Rungs the quantum can take, in **frames**.

 *
 * Frames rather than the round milliseconds this used to use — `[250, 500,
 * 1000, ...]` — because 250ms was the finest rung and that is no longer fine
 * enough. A tile is `clipH * aspect ≈ 71px` wide, so at the zoom where a frame
 * is 50px one tile spans 24ms: fifteen consecutive tiles quantised to the same
 * 250ms instant and the strip drew the same picture ten times in a row, under a
 * grid claiming each column was a different frame.
 *
 * Powers of two, so a rung is always a whole number of frames and adjacent
 * rungs stay far enough apart to be stable under a zoom nudge.
