/**
 * Document-level edits to how a clip sounds: splitting its audio onto a track
 * of its own, and setting how loud it plays.
 *
 * The document-level half of `audio.ts`: that file decides what a detached
 * clip *is* and what a level means, this one decides where the twin lands,
 * what happens to the video it came from, and how a level reaches an element.
 * Detaching is one edit — the twin appears and the source falls silent in the
 * same document — so `withCheckpoint` records exactly one undo step and a
 * single Cmd+Z puts the project back, new track included.
 *
 * Nothing links the two clips afterwards. That is the feature, not an
 * omission: an audio clip you cannot drag away from its picture is not
 * detached, it is just drawn on another row.

/**
 * Set how loud a clip plays, in dB.

 * every mousemove, so a scrub that wanders back across its starting value
 * would otherwise record a step for standing still. `GestureCommit` reads the
 * identity to mean "nothing happened" and commits nothing.
 *
 * The comparison is against `volumeDbOf`, not the raw field. A clip with no
 * `volumeDb` *is* at 0 dB, so setting it to 0 has to decline rather than stamp
 * a redundant `volumeDb: 0` onto every clip the user clicks — which would grow
 * the saved project and make "untouched" unrepresentable.
 *
 * A clip whose level is **keyframed** still has this static field, and setting
 * it still means something: it is the value the envelope falls back to before
 * the track's first sample and wherever the track is switched off. It is not
 * what the clip plays at a cursor while the track is live, which is
 * `audio.ts#volumeDbAt`. `withStaticValue` calls through here for exactly that
 * reason, when the last keyframe of an envelope is removed.
 *
 * The clamp lives here rather than in the panel because `number-input` ignores
 * `min`/`max` entirely — the `max="100"` on the opacity field has never done
 * anything — so clamping at the one place every caller passes through is what
 * actually keeps the store in range, whether the value came from a drag, from
 * a typed number, or from `update_clip`.
