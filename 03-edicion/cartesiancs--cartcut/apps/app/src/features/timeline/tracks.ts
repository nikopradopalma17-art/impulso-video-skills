/**
 * The track registry: the thing this codebase never had.
 *
 * A row used to be the enumeration index of an element within the
 * priority-sorted timeline — a loop counter, not stored state — so one element
 * always occupied exactly one row. Splitting a clip therefore *had* to invent a
 * new row, and forty caption lines produced forty of them.
 *
 * Now a track is a real object and `trackId` says which one a clip belongs to.
 * Many clips share a track; the row is a property of the track, not of the
 * clip.
 *
 * Z-order is derived from track order rather than stored per element:
 * **index 0 is the topmost row and the front-most layer**, matching Premiere
 * and Final Cut. `derivePriorities` writes that ordering back into the legacy
 * `priority` field so the compositor, the preview and both FFmpeg export paths
 * keep working untouched while the UI migrates.
