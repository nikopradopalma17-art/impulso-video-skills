/**
 * The zoom mapping, in one place.
 *
 * Three callers used to own a copy of this and disagree about it: the slider
 * (`elementTimelineRange.updateRange`) mapped its position through
 * `sigmoid(x) * 10`, its inverse re-derived `x` with a logit, and the ctrl+wheel
 * handler clamped with `next < 5 ? ... : next > -8` — comparing a *range* value
 * of 0..10 against the slider's *logit* bounds. Since range is never negative,
 * `next > -8` was always true and zooming out was effectively unclamped.
 *
 * Two things changed beyond collecting them.
 *
 * The ceiling moved. `sigmoid(x) * 10` cannot exceed 10 however far the slider
 * travels, and at range 10 one 60fps frame is 8.3px — barely enough to see a
 * frame grid, let alone edit against it. Frame-accurate work needs a frame to
 * be a comfortable target, so the ceiling is now 60, where a 60fps frame is
 * exactly 50px.
 *
 * And the curve is exponential rather than logistic. A sigmoid saturates at
 * both ends, so raising its ceiling piles the entire useful range into the last
 * few percent of slider travel. An exponential gives a constant *ratio* of
 * magnification per unit of travel, which is what every NLE's zoom control
 * does and what makes the far end usable at all.
 *
 * The floor is unchanged, deliberately: it is the exact value the old mapping
 * produced at the slider's minimum, so zooming *out* behaves exactly as before.

 * How far in a project at `fps` may zoom.
 *
 * The ceiling above is a *frame* measurement wearing a millisecond's clothes:
 * 60 is not a round number, it is "the range at which one 60fps frame is 50px
 * wide". Left as a constant it silently means something different at every
 * other rate — a 120fps frame gets 25px at the same ceiling, and a 240fps one
 * 12.5px, which is below the width the frame grid is even willing to draw at.
 * So the ceiling is derived from the same statement it always encoded, and
 * `MAX_RANGE` keeps its meaning as the 60fps case of it.
 *
 * The `max(1, …)` is what keeps this from being a regression at low rates.
 * Scaling in both directions would put a 30fps project's ceiling at 30 — where
 * one frame is still 50px, so nothing about frame-accurate editing is lost, but
 * where the user can nonetheless zoom *less far in absolute time* than they
 * could yesterday. Nothing is gained by taking that away. The rule is therefore
 * "always far enough that a frame is 50px, and never less far than before".
