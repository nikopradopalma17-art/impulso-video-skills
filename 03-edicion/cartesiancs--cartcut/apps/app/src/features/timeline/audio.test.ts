/**
 * Reading a clip's level, and turning it into something that can be played.
 *
 * Two exact values carry more weight than the arithmetic around them, and both
 * are asserted here rather than trusted:
 *
 *   - `gainOf` at 0 dB is exactly `1`. That is what lets `audioFilterFor` drop
 *     the `volume=` stage entirely, so a project nobody has mixed reaches
 *     FFmpeg with no level filter. If it drifts to 0.999999, every export
 *     gains a stage and the pinned filter strings all break at once.
 *   - `gainOf` at the floor is exactly `0`, not the arithmetic 0.001. When the
 *     user pulls a fader to the bottom they mean silence, and 0.1% of a loud
 *     source is plainly audible.
 *
 * The defaulting matters as much as the conversion. Nothing migrates a project
 * on load, so "field absent" is the normal state for every clip in every file
 * written before this feature — it has to be indistinguishable from 0 dB
 * everywhere, or opening an old project changes how it sounds.
