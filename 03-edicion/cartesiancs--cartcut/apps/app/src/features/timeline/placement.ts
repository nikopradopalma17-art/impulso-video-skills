/**
 * Where a newly added element lands.

 * Everything used to go to `startTime: 0` with `priority = max + 1`, which
 * meant a brand-new row every single time. Forty caption lines became forty
 * rows; adding a second clip never continued the first one's track.
 *
 * The rule now is: reuse a track of the right kind if the requested moment is
 * free on one, and only add a track when none of them can take it. Because
 * captions arrive with distinct, non-overlapping times, that single rule is
 * what collapses a whole transcript onto one text track.
