/**
 * Document-level edits to a text clip's reveal.
 *
 * Deliberately shaped like `maskOps.ts`, `lutOps.ts` and `blendOps.ts`, because
 * the same three rules apply and only one of them is obvious:
 *
 *  1. **Not every element can carry a reveal.** A reveal counts units of text,
 *     and only a text clip has any. Writing the field onto a video would put it
 *     in the saved project, through every undo snapshot and into the agent's
 *     serialiser, where nothing would ever read it.
 *  2. **Clearing deletes the key rather than storing a null.** A `.ngt` is
 *     written by `JSON.stringify`, which drops an `undefined` — but
 *     `structuredClone`, which the copy path uses, keeps it. Storing a default
 *     would make the saved project and the in-memory one disagree about whether
 *     the clip had ever been revealed.
 *  3. **Declining returns the document by identity**, the contract every op in
 *     `clipOps` holds — `withCheckpoint` reads identity to mean "nothing
 *     happened" and records no undo step. Picking the unit a clip already has
 *     costs the user nothing.
 *
 * ## A reveal and its keyframe track are seeded and removed together
 *
 * `revealProgress` exists on a clip only while it has a reveal —
 * `animatableProperties` gates on `element.reveal != null`, which is what makes
 * `keyframeOps.resolve` refuse a reveal keyframe on a plain text clip with no
 * extra guard. So applying a reveal seeds the empty track and clearing one
 * removes it, in the same transform, and a document is never left with either
 * half alone. The mask does exactly this, for exactly this reason.
 *
 * The track is seeded **only where absent**, so changing the unit on a clip
 * whose progress the user has already keyed leaves those curves where they are.
 * Switching from typing by character to typing by word is a change of cadence,
 * not a reason to throw away the timing.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * There is no `startMs` and no `durationMs`. A reveal's timing lives in
 * `element.animation.revealProgress`, where `rebaseAnimation`,
 * `sliceAnimation` and `rebakeElement` already carry it through split, trim,
 * duplicate, paste and a project frame-rate change. Storing times on the field
 * instead would mean reimplementing every one of those in `clipOps`, and the
 * one that was forgotten would fail silently on one edit.
