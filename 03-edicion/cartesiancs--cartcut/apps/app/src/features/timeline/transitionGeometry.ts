/**
 * The arithmetic of a cut: handles, windows, and how long a transition can be.
 *
 * Split from `transitionOps.ts` for one reason, and it is a hard one:
 * `repairTransitions` runs inside `normalizeDocument`, so anything it imports
 * must not import `tracks.ts` back. This module depends on `geometry.ts` and
 * the element types and nothing else, which is what lets both the repair pass
 * and the editing ops share one copy of the maths.
 *
 * ## Handles
 *
 * A transition needs frames from outside the cut: the outgoing clip has to keep
 * playing past its out-point, and the incoming one has to start before its
 * in-point. Those frames exist in the source file but sit outside `trim` — what
 * an NLE calls *handles*.
 *
 * They are finite. A clip trimmed to the last frame of its source has no tail
 * at all, and a two-second centred dissolve there is asking for frames that do
 * not exist. Everything below is in service of answering "how much is actually
 * there?" before anything is written, so the ops can shrink the transition
 * rather than produce one that renders a frozen frame.
 *
 * A static element — an image, a title, a shape — has infinite handles, because
 * there is no source window to run out of. That is why transitions between
 * stills always work and every interesting case is video.

/**
 * The longest transition this cut can hold, in timeline ms.
 *
 * Bounded by the **clips' own lengths** and nothing else. A transition cannot
 * reach back past the outgoing clip's start or forward past the incoming
 * clip's end — there is no picture there at all — so those are hard limits:
 *
 *  - **center** — the window straddles the cut, taking `d/2` from each side,
 *    so `d/2` is bounded by both clips' lengths.
 *  - **end** — the window sits entirely before the cut, inside the outgoing
 *    clip. Only its length matters.
 *  - **start** — the mirror image.
 *
 * Handles are deliberately **not** a limit here, and that was the bug. A
 * freshly imported clip is trimmed to its whole source (`trim` is
 * `0..sourceDuration`), so it has exactly zero handle on either side — which
 * made this return 0 for the single most common edit there is: two imports
 * dropped end to end. The transition was then refused, and the advice to try
 * another alignment was impossible too, because all three need a handle.
 *
 * What happens instead is `freezeMs` below: where the source runs out the clip
 * holds its last or first frame. That is what the renderer already does —
 * `sourceTimeAt` extrapolates past `trim` and the media element clamps at its
 * own bounds — so the only thing that ever prevented it was this function.

/**
 * How far through a transition the playhead is, 0..1.
 *
 * **`timeInMs` is snapped to the frame grid before anything else happens, and
 * that is not a rounding nicety — it is what makes preview and export agree.**
 *
 * The two paths sample the timeline differently. Export walks frame indices:
 * `frameTimeMs(n, fps)` is exactly `(n / fps) * 1000`. The preview's playback
 * loop derives the cursor from the wall clock — `Date.now() - startTime` in
 * `elementControl.step`. That cursor is floored onto the frame grid now
 * (`playbackClock.ts`), but it reaches this function through scrubs, keyframe
 * edits and the agent bridge as well, and not all of those are quantized.
 *
 * For everything that existed before transitions that difference was harmless:
 * sampling a keyframe 8ms off shows a marginally different frame and nobody can
 * tell. Feeding it to a shader is not harmless. `progress` becomes a slightly
 * different number in the preview than in the render, so the exported file does
 * not match what the user approved — and the discrepancy is invisible until
 * they compare the two side by side.
 *
 * Snapping here fixes it at the one place the value is derived, whatever the
 * caller did or did not do first. `frames.ts#frameStartMs` is built on the
 * exporter's own expression, bit for bit, so the two agree exactly rather than
 * approximately.
 *
 * **Floor, not nearest.** `snapMsToFrame` rounds, which is right for its own
 * job — a dragged clip should land on the closest frame line. It is wrong here.
 * Frame `n` is displayed throughout `[n/fps, (n+1)/fps)`, and export renders it
 * at the start of that span; a cursor two thirds of the way through frame 70
 * would round *up* to 71 and show the next frame's progress while the playhead
 * is still inside 70. Flooring makes "which frame is on screen" and "which
 * frame is being rendered" the same question.
