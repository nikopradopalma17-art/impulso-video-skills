/**
 * Document-level edits to a full-frame effect.
 *
 * Modelled on `filterOps.ts`, including the rule that matters most: **switching
 * preset replaces the parameters rather than carrying them over.** That file's
 * header explains what carrying them over costs — a blur's `f=5` reinterpreted
 * as a chromakey threshold makes `distance() < 5` always true and the clip
 * renders fully transparent. Preset parameters here are keyed by name rather
 * than by position, which makes a silent collision less likely but not
 * impossible: two presets can both declare `amount` and mean quite different
 * ranges by it. Re-seeding from the new preset's defaults is the only version
 * that cannot surprise anyone.
 *
 * The caller supplies those defaults. This module stays DOM-free and knows
 * nothing about the preset registry, which reads from disk.
 *
 * Every mutator returns the document **by identity** when it changes nothing,
 * the contract `withCheckpoint` reads as "no undo step".
