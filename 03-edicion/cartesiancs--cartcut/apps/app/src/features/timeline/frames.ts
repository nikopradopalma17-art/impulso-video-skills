/**
 * The frame as the atomic unit of editing.
 *
 * Before this module the timeline's finest unit was the millisecond:
 * `applyDrag` rounded a pixel delta to an integer ms and a clip could sit
 * anywhere. The exporter, meanwhile, samples the timeline at exactly
 * `currentFrame / fps * 1000` (`features/export/renderTimeline.ts`), so an edit
 * and its render disagreed by construction — at 60fps a frame is 16.666…ms, a
 * number no integer millisecond can name.
 *
 * Hence the one invariant everything here exists to serve:
 *
 *   every timeline instant an edit produces is exactly `n * 1000 / fps`
 *   for some integer `n`.
 *
 * The way to keep it is to never accumulate. `frameToMs` recomputes from an
 * integer index every time, so a thousand steps forward lands on the same
 * double as one jump of a thousand — which repeated addition does not:
 * adding `1000/60` sixty times gives 999.9999999999991, not 1000. That is the
 * bug behind the arrow keys, and it is why frame arithmetic goes through a
 * frame *index* rather than a millisecond *step*.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free, and fps arrives as an argument rather than being read from
 * a store — the same shape as `geometry.ts` and `snapping.ts`, so this runs
 * under `environment: "node"`.

 *
 * Not the same question as "what time is this frame", which is `frameToMs`.
 * This one is about picking a discrete source frame through a continuous,
 * lossily-quantised parameter, and the two answers differ by half a frame.
 *
 * A professional NLE never faces this: it converts a timeline frame index to a
 * *source frame index* with integer or rational arithmetic, and addresses the
 * decoder by presentation timestamp in the stream's own timebase, compared
 * exactly. No float seconds are involved anywhere, so there is no tie to lose.
 *
 * An HTML `<video>` gives us no such handle. The only address is
 * `currentTime`, a double in seconds, and the frame it selects is the one whose
 * presentation interval `[pts, pts + duration)` contains that value. Asking for
 * exactly `pts` is therefore a boundary case — and Chromium stores the
 * assignment as whole **microseconds**, so whenever `1e6 / fps` is not an
 * integer the request lands one microsecond *below* the boundary and the
 * decoder correctly returns the previous frame. Measured against this app:
 * requesting `0.0666667` read back as `0.066666`, and the composited frame
 * carried source index 1 where 2 was wanted. At 30fps that spoiled a third of
 * every export; at 60fps, two thirds.
 *
 * Sampling at the frame's **centre** removes the tie. It is the same convention
 * as sampling a texel at its centre rather than its corner, and it is what the
 * comparable seek in the E2E suite does for the same reason
 * (`tests/e2e/harness/decode.ts` seeks to `(N - 0.25) / fps`). The margin it
 * buys is half a frame — 8,333 microseconds at 60fps against a 1 microsecond
 * quantisation, a factor of over eight thousand — so no rounding this side of a
 * rewrite can push the request into a neighbouring frame.
 *
 * Snapping to the covering frame first, rather than simply adding half a frame
 * to whatever came in, is what makes this exact for an off-grid `ms` too: the
 * centre wanted is the centre of the frame that *contains* `ms`, which is only
 * `ms + half` when `ms` already sits on a boundary.
 *
 * The real fix is to stop addressing frames by float seconds at all — WebCodecs
 * `VideoDecoder` takes an integer timestamp — but that is a rewrite of the
 * media layer, and this is correct in the meantime rather than merely adequate.
