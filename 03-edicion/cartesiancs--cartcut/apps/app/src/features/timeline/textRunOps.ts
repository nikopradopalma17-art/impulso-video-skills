/**
 * Document-level edits to a text clip's per-range style.
 *
 * The three rules `blendOps.ts` states hold here too: only a text clip can
 * carry runs, the default deletes the key rather than storing it, and declining
 * returns the document by identity so `withCheckpoint` records no undo step.
 *
 * One rule is this module's own, and it is what makes the second of those true
 * for a *sparse* field. **A patch field equal to the clip's own value is
 * dropped before it is written.** Painting a range the colour it already is
 * therefore produces an empty style, which `applyRunStyle` drops, which leaves
 * no runs, which deletes the field. Without it "select all, pick the same
 * colour" would store a run that changes nothing and a project saved after the
 * feature would differ from the same project saved before it.
 *
 * Validation is not here. `text/runs.ts#coerceRunStyle` runs at the panel
 * boundary, which is the only place a bad value can be reported usefully, and
 * again inside `applyRunStyle` so nothing outside the vocabulary can reach the
 * document from either direction.
