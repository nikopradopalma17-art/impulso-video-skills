/**
 * What a press on a clip turns into.
 *
 * Two gestures start identically — a press on a clip body — and have to be told
 * apart without a modifier key: sliding a clip along its track, and lifting it
 * onto a different one. Time separates them. Move early and it is a horizontal
 * slide, with vertical motion ignored so a shaky hand cannot fling a clip onto
 * the wrong row. Hold still for a moment and the clip comes free, after which
 * vertical movement means what it looks like.
 *
 * Keeping this as a reducer with an injected clock is what makes the boundaries
 * testable: 219ms versus 220ms, 4px versus 5px. None of that is observable
 * once it is tangled into mouse handlers.
