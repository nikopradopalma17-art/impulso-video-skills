/**
 * What every media element should be doing right now.
 *
 * This is the layer that was missing. Playback decisions used to be scattered
 * across three places that each knew only part of the picture:
 *
 *   - `loadedAssetStore` seeded every `<video>` once at play time from a
 *     **snapshot** of the clip taken when the file loaded, so moving a clip
 *     shifted its playback position by exactly the drag distance;
 *   - `renderer/video.ts` decided audibility, but the compositor skips clips
 *     outside their window, so its "mute me" branch never actually ran and a
 *     clip that left the playhead kept sounding over whatever came next;
 *   - `elementControl.showAudio` did its own arithmetic that ignored `trim`
 *     and `speed` entirely, so a split audio clip replayed the deleted part.
 *
 * All three are the same question — *given the live clip and the playhead,
 * where should this handle be, and should it be heard?* — so it is answered
 * once, here, from the live element only. There is nowhere to put a snapshot.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free: the only thing it knows about a media element is
 * `MediaHandle`, which a plain object satisfies. That is what finally makes
 * this layer testable under `environment: "node"`.
