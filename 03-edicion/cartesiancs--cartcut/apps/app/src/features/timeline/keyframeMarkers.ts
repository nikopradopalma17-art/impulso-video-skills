/**
 * Where a clip's keyframe diamonds go.

 * Deliberately *not* part of `TimelineLayout`. The markers are display-only —
 * they take no part in hit-testing — and keeping them out of the object
 * `hitTest` walks makes that structural rather than merely tested: there is no
 * marker data in there for a press to land on, however the hit-test changes
 * later. It also keeps `layoutTimeline`, which runs on every pointer move,
 * from doing a union-and-sort per clip for something only the painter needs.
 *
 * Keyframe times are stored relative to `element.startTime` in *timeline*
 * milliseconds. `ClipRect.x` is already the element's start in screen pixels,
 * so a marker sits at `rect.x + msToPxSigned(t, range)` — no scroll term, and
 * no speed term either: a 2x clip's keyframe at t=1000 lands one second of
 * timeline along, which is where it plays.
