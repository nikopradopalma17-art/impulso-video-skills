/**
 * Transitions: the arithmetic of a cut, and the ops that place one.
 *
 * A transition is a **binary operator on two rendered frames**, not an
 * animation applied to a clip. That distinction decides the whole design.
 *
 * The tempting alternative is to express a slide by writing `position`
 * keyframes onto the two clips. It does not survive contact with real edits:
 * the generated keyframes fight whatever the user already authored, changing
 * the transition's length means recomputing them, and deleting it means
 * knowing which keyframes were ours. Editing becomes destructive.
 *
 * So nothing here writes a keyframe. Clip A evaluates its own animation into
 * one buffer, clip B into another, and the transition mixes the two — a slide
 * is a UV offset in a fragment shader, a swirl is a different fragment shader,
 * and the system cannot tell them apart. Keyframes animate *parameters*;
 * shaders transform *textures*; the two axes stay orthogonal.
 *
 * The second decision is that placing a transition **does not move or trim
 * either clip**. `startTime` and `trim` are untouched on both sides. The
 * transition is a window laid over the cut, and the renderer reads past A's
 * out-point and before B's in-point to fill it — the source frames that are
 * already in the file but outside the trim, what an NLE calls *handles*.
 *
 * That is what keeps `overlap.ts`'s no-overlap invariant intact: the clips
 * still meet at exactly one instant. `occupiesTrack` excludes the transition
 * itself from occupancy arithmetic, and that single exception is the entire
 * cost. Removing a transition restores the edit precisely, and undo needs no
 * special case.
 *
 * Handles are finite, though, and that is what most of this file computes. A
 * clip trimmed to the last frame of its source has no tail; asking for a 2s
 * centred dissolve there is asking for frames that do not exist. The policy is
 * to **shrink rather than refuse**: the transition takes the longest length the
 * two clips can actually supply, and `requestedDuration` remembers what was
 * asked for so the panel can say so and so a later trim can restore it.
 *
 * The arithmetic itself lives in `transitionGeometry.ts`, which imports nothing
 * from `tracks.ts` — that is what lets `repairTransitions` run inside
 * `normalizeDocument` and still share one copy of it with these ops.
 *
 * DOM-free, like the rest of `features/timeline/`.
