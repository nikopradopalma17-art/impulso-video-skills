/**
 * A region that can hold docked windows, and the splitters between them.
 *
 * This is the only component in the feature that knows about layout. It
 * measures itself, hands the size to `windowStore`, asks `layoutHost` for the
 * frames, and writes their rects as inline styles. One `<app-window>` is drawn
 * per frame, carrying every window docked to that side as a tab; it is chrome
 * and nothing else.
 *
 * Frames are rendered through `repeat`, keyed by `WindowFrame.key`. A plain
 * `map` reuses elements by position, so closing the first of two frames handed
 * its `<app-window>` to the second and rebuilt that frame's panels from scratch.
 *
 * Geometry is written as an inline `style` rather than through CSS classes on
 * purpose: there is then exactly one place a rect is decided, it is a pure
 * function with a test, and a stylesheet cannot quietly disagree with it.
 *
 * ## The splitter
 *
 * The gesture is the idiom the app's four other dividers use, a flag plus
 * window-level `mousemove`/`mouseup`. What is different is that the arithmetic
 * is not here: `windowDrag.ts#resolveWindowDrag` owns it, so the case that
 * actually breaks splitters, what happens at the ends of their travel, is
 * reachable from a node test. The four existing ones keep theirs inline in a
 * `mousemove` handler and none of them has a test.
 *
 * Unlike those four, the listeners are removed on disconnect. They are bound
 * once and kept, rather than `.bind(this)` at registration time, which is what
 * makes that possible: a fresh function per call is a listener nobody can ever
 * take off again.
