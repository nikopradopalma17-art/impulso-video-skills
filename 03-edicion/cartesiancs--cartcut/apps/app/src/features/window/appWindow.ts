/**
 * A frame's chrome: a strip of tabs, and a body showing one of them.
 *
 * Deliberately knows nothing about layout, the store, or which host it is in.
 * It is handed a position by `<window-host>` as an inline style and its tabs as
 * Lit templates, and it reports a tab chosen or closed by event. That makes it
 * usable for a plain dialog later without dragging a docking model in behind it.
 *
 * ## The tabs are `<preview-top-bar>`'s tabs
 *
 * Same chip, same classes (`.tb-tab` in `_toolbar.scss`), and the close glyph
 * sits inside the tab straight after its label (`previewTopBar.ts#_renderTab`). The frame stands beside the
 * preview column's own top bar at the same 2rem, so the two read as one strip
 * across the column; a title chip with its close pushed to the far edge read as
 * a different kind of thing.
 *
 * ## Every tab stays mounted
 *
 * A tab that is not on show is hidden, not removed. The caption panel holds a
 * running session and Text to Speech holds what was typed into it, and removing
 * either to show the other would throw that away. `repeat` keys each pane by the
 * tab's id so closing one tab never hands its element to another.
 *
 * ## Why the body arrives as a template rather than through a `<slot>`
 *
 * A light-DOM Lit component's `render()` **replaces its children**, so the
 * usual way to wrap arbitrary content is a shadow root with a slot. This app
 * does not do that, and the reason is written at
 * `features/option/controlAudioVolume.ts:53`: the global stylesheet does not
 * cross a shadow boundary, so rendering chrome into a shadow root leaves it
 * unstyled, and it fails in a way that looks like a CSS problem rather than an
 * architectural one. 70 of the app's 70 components that override
 * `createRenderRoot` return `this`.
 *
 * A `TemplateResult` property is the light-DOM equivalent of a slot. Lit keeps
 * the element instances inside it stable across re-renders, so the
 * `<automatic-caption>` in the body is created once and not rebuilt every time
 * the host re-lays out.
 *
 * ## The contract with whatever is in the body
 *
 * The body is `overflow: hidden` and establishes a container named
 * `appwindow`. A panel inside it gets a definite box (see `_window.scss`) and
 * owns its own scrolling and its own footer, which is what `autoTrackPanel`
 * already does. Scrolling here instead would put a panel's footer at the bottom
 * of its content rather than at the bottom of the window.
