/**
 * Turning a preset's fragment source into a program the pipeline can compile.
 *
 * ## Transitions use the `gl-transitions` contract, unchanged
 *
 * An author writes one function and nothing else:
 *
 * ```glsl
 * vec4 transition(vec2 uv) {
 *   return mix(getFromColor(uv), getToColor(uv), progress);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * and the host supplies `from`, `to`, `progress`, `ratio`, `_fromR`, `_toR`,
 * the two `get*Color` helpers, and `main`.
 *
 * Inventing our own contract here — `u_from` / `u_to` / `u_progress`, say —
 * would have cost the entire existing ecosystem. `gl-transitions` publishes
 * around eighty transitions against exactly this interface; adopting it means
 * every one of them drops into `userData/presets/` and works with no edit at
 * all, and that a third-party author already knows how to write for this app.
 * The point of the preset system is extensibility, and a private dialect is the
 * one decision that would have undercut it.
 *
 * Authors declare their own parameter uniforms, as they do upstream, so this
 * wrapper must NOT emit declarations for them — two declarations of one name is
 * a compile error. `presetValidate.ts` checks that each declared parameter is
 * actually present in the source, so the mismatch surfaces when the preset
 * loads rather than as a shader log at first paint.
 *
 * ## Effects use the same shape with one input
 *
 * An adjustment layer reads what is already drawn beneath it:
 *
 * ```glsl
 * vec4 effect(vec2 uv) {
 *   return vec4(getSourceColor(uv).rgb * 1.2, 1.0);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * No aspect correction is needed on this side: the compositor renders into a
 * scratch canvas at project resolution, so the source texture and the output
 * are the same shape by construction. That is also why `ratio` and the two
 * `_*R` uniforms are constants for transitions here — both clips are drawn to
 * project-resolution buffers before they are ever sampled.
 *
 * Pure string work, DOM-free, and tested as such. The GLSL cannot be compiled
 * under `environment: "node"`, which is the same split `filter/parse.test.ts`
 * lives with: the string handling is tested, the shader is verified by running
 * the app.
