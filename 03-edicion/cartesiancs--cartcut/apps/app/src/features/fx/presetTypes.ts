/**
 * What a preset is, as a type.
 *
 * A preset is **declarative data plus GLSL, and never JavaScript**. That is a
 * security boundary, not a style preference: presets are downloaded and
 * installed by users, and they are consumed in an Electron renderer where
 * `window.electronAPI` is in scope. GLSL has no I/O and cannot reach any of it;
 * a `prepare()` hook would hand a stranger's code the filesystem.
 *
 * The schema therefore has to be expressive enough that authors do not *want*
 * an escape hatch. What it covers:
 *
 *  - a fragment shader, in the `gl-transitions` dialect (see `glslWrap.ts`)
 *  - an optional vertex shader and mesh, for transitions that need real
 *    geometry rather than a full-screen quad — a cube rotation or a page curl
 *  - extra textures the preset ships with, for luma wipes and light leaks
 *  - a `precompute` request, naming one of a **closed set** of analyses the app
 *    implements — the answer to "but optical flow needs code"
 *  - parameters, in four kinds, each of which the panel can render and each of
 *    which binds to exactly one GLSL uniform
 *
 * These types live in the renderer and nowhere else. The main process is a dumb
 * file server that reads bytes and knows nothing about any of this — which is
 * what keeps the `electron/` -> `apps/app/src` import ban from forcing a
 * hand-maintained duplicate of the schema, the way `ffmpegArgs.ts` has to
 * duplicate `isAudible`.
