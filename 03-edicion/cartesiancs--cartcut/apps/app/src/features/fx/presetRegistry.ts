/**
 * The installed presets, as one lookup.
 *
 * Loaded once at startup and held in a module-level map, the way the font
 * preset list is: the set only changes when someone installs something, and a
 * panel that re-read the disk on every render would stall the UI.
 *
 * The single rule that shapes this file: **built-in and user presets are
 * indistinguishable downstream.** They come from different directories and
 * carry different `origin` tags for display, and that is the entire difference.
 * Same loader, same validator, same failure modes. If a third-party preset were
 * going to break, a built-in one would break in the same place — which is the
 * only way to know the format actually works for anyone but us.
 *
 * The other rule is that **a missing preset is not an error state to handle
 * downstream.** `presetById` returns `null`, the compositor draws a
 * pass-through, and the panel shows a badge. The element keeps its `presetId`
 * and its `params` untouched, so opening a project on a machine without the
 * preset and saving it again loses nothing — the same shape of promise
 * `hierarchy.ts` makes about a `parentId` naming a deleted group.
