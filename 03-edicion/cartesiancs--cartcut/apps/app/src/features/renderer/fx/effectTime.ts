/**
 * How far into an effect the playhead is, in seconds.
 *
 * The `time` uniform every effect shader receives, and the thing that makes an
 * animated effect possible at all. Without it a shader has no way to differ
 * between one frame and the next: the shipped `film-grain` computed its noise
 * from `gl_FragCoord` alone, so the "grain" was a fixed stain that never moved.
 *
 * Two decisions, both of which have bitten this codebase before in other forms.
 *
 * **Element-local.** Measured from the effect's own `startTime`, not from the
 * timeline origin. An effect therefore behaves identically wherever it is
 * dragged to — a flicker that starts on its first frame keeps starting on its
 * first frame. Timeline-absolute time would make an effect look different for
 * no reason the user could see.
 *
 * **Frame-snapped, by exactly the rule `progressOf` uses.** The preview and the
 * export reach this from different directions — a wall clock in
 * `elementControl.step` against a frame index in `renderTimeline` — and while
 * both now floor onto the same grid before they get here, this snap is what
 * makes that a guarantee rather than a coincidence of two call sites. Feeding
 * an unsnapped instant straight
 * into a shader means the grain pattern in the render is not the one the user
 * approved in the preview — invisible until they compare, and impossible to
 * explain afterwards. Flooring to the frame grid with the exporter's own
 * expression makes the two bit-identical.
 *
 * See `transitionGeometry.ts#progressOf`, which carries the long version of
 * this reasoning; this is the same fix for the other animated uniform.
