/**
 * What the compositor has to do differently on this frame.
 *
 * Deciding it up front, as one pure function, rather than inside the paint
 * loop. Three reasons, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 *  1. **The scratch decision must be made before the first pixel is drawn.** A
 *     shader effect reads back the composited frame, which only works if the
 *     frame was composited into a canvas at project resolution with an identity
 *     transform. The preview's target is neither — it is device-sized and
 *     carries the viewport's pan and zoom. So either everything goes into a
 *     scratch canvas from the start, or nothing does; there is no way to
 *     discover halfway through that one was needed.
 *  2. **A transition draws two clips at once**, so the loop needs to know which
 *     ids to skip *before* it reaches them.
 *  3. It is testable under `environment: "node"`, where there is no WebGL. All
 *     the decisions live here; `FxCompositor` only executes them.
 *
 * The other property worth stating: when a document has no effects and no
 * transitions, this returns a plan that says "do nothing", and
 * `renderTimelineAtTime` takes byte-for-byte the path it always took. That is
 * what lets the existing golden pixel suites keep passing untouched.
