/**
 * Grading with `ImageData`, on the CPU.
 *
 * Two jobs, and it is the same code doing both:
 *
 *  - **The fallback that ships.** A machine with no usable WebGL context still
 *    grades; it grades slowly, and it grades correctly.
 *  - **The path the node suites run.** `renderer/lutComposite.test.ts` drives
 *    the real `renderElement` with this applier and a Skia surface, and checks
 *    the resulting bytes against `sampleLut`. Because this is a shipping path
 *    and not a test double, that suite is testing the app rather than a mock.
 *
 * ## Alpha
 *
 * `getImageData` is defined to return **straight**, non-premultiplied values,
 * so the grade goes straight onto `data[i]` with no unpremultiply step — the
 * same numbers the GPU shader sees, for the reasons set out in `lut/glsl.ts`.
 * Alpha itself is left alone: a LUT is a colour transform and says nothing
 * about coverage.
 *
 * ## Speed
 *
 * A 1920×1080 layer is two million tetrahedral lookups, which is tens of
 * milliseconds — fine for an export and too slow for a 60fps preview. That is
 * the whole reason the GPU applier is tried first. The one concession made
 * here is a **memo keyed on the packed 8-bit colour**: real footage has far
 * fewer distinct colours than pixels, a solid title card has one, and the map
 * turns the second occurrence of a colour into a lookup. It is exact, not an
 * approximation — the key is the entire input.
