  // There used to be a span check here, and removing it was necessary rather
  // than tidy.
  //
  // It was already redundant: `renderTimelineAtTime` calls
  // `isElementVisibleAtTime` before it calls any renderer, so a clip outside
  // its window never reached this function. Transitions made it actively
  // wrong. A cross-dissolve asks the outgoing clip to keep drawing *past* its
  // out-point — that is the whole mechanism — and this check, which knew only
  // `spanOf` and had no way to learn about the transition, answered "not
  // visible" and drew nothing. The dissolve would have blended against black
  // for its second half.
  //
  // Audibility is deliberately not decided here either, and never was: a
  // "mute me now" branch in this file could not fire for the clip that needs
  // it, which is why audio once kept playing over a cut.
  // `features/timeline/playback.ts` owns that, driven from the preview's draw
  // path where every handle is visited whether it is on screen or not.
  // The silhouette is the box: both branches below fill `0,0,w,h`, so a shadow
  // cast from the box is a shadow cast from the picture. A chroma key is the
  // one case where that is a simplification — the keyed-out region still casts
  // — and it is the right one: the shadow belongs to the clip, and a shadow
  // that changed shape frame by frame as the key moved would read as a bug.
