/**
 * Whether the project has diverged from what is on disk.
 *
 * One owner for one question. Three surfaces ask it — File → Open, the quit
 * guard, and Auto Save — and they must not be able to disagree: a quit guard
 * that waves through a state Auto Save thinks is dirty is a lost session with
 * a dialog that said nothing.
 *
 * It replaces `features/element/elementTimeline.ts`'s
 * `timelineHashTable`/`isTimelineChange`, whose defects are catalogued in
 * `projectDigest.ts`. The one that mattered most: it hashed elements only, so
 * a track rename or reorder read as unmodified and Open would
 * `clearTimeline()` straight over it.
 *
 * ## Not a store
 *
 * Nothing repaints on this. A zustand store would invite a subscriber, and a
 * subscriber on `useTimelineStore` fires at the display rate during playback
 * (there is no `subscribeWithSelector` here). It is session state with one
 * owner, read on demand.
 *
 * ## The baseline is set from the store, never from the file
 *
 * `patchDocument` runs `normalizeAnimations`, then optionally
 * `rebakeAnimations`, then `normalizeDocument` — so the document in the store
 * after a load is **not** byte-identical to the `timeline.json` it came from.
 * Baselining from the file therefore reads as dirty immediately, and the first
 * autosave writes a file identical in meaning to the `.ngt` for no reason.
 * Every `markProjectSaved` below takes its digest from the store.
