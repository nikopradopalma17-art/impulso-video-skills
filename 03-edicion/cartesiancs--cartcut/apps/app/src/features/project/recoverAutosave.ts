/**
 * Recovering an Auto Save. The only way back into the cache.
 *
 * Reached from File → Auto Save and from nowhere else — no button, no
 * keystroke, no automatic offer on launch. A recovery replaces everything on
 * the timeline, so it has to be something the user asked for in as many words.
 *
 * ## The guard: non-empty **or** dirty
 *
 * Stricter than File → Open's, and deliberately so. Open refuses on *dirty*
 * only, because a clean project is on disk and opening another loses nothing —
 * refusing there on non-empty would mean never being able to open a second
 * project. A recovery has no such out: it overwrites whatever is loaded, saved
 * or not, so a non-empty timeline is reason enough to refuse.
 *
 * `tracks.length` counts on its own. Three added rows and nothing else is work
 * worth refusing over, and it is exactly what the detector this replaced read
 * as unmodified.
 *
 * ## The session comes back detached
 *
 * `#projectFile` is left **empty**, so ⌘S opens Save As and the original
 * `.ngt` is never touched by a recovery. The archive's anchor is read — it has
 * to be, or the relative asset paths resolve against `userData/autosave` and
 * every clip reports as missing media — but it is used for that and nothing
 * else. Adopting it as the project's path is what would make the next ⌘S
 * overwrite the user's file with a recovered older state, so the path port
 * exists here and is never called, and the suite asserts that.
 *
 * ## The ring is not touched
 *
 * Reading one entry leaves the other nine alone. They are still the only
 * copies of those states, and a user who picked 14:22 when they meant 14:25
 * must not have destroyed the right one by looking at the wrong one.
