/**
 * Reading a `.ngt`'s entries into a document. The one load order.
 *
 * Three callers need it — `functions/project.ts#load`, Auto Save recovery, and
 * `template/templateDocument.ts` — and the order is load-bearing in ways that
 * are invisible if you get them wrong, so a second implementation would drift
 * and the drift would be silent. It lives here rather than in `project.ts`
 * because that module reaches for `document.querySelector`,
 * `window.electronAPI` and JSZip within a few lines of every branch, so a
 * question like "does a recovered autosave relink the same way a project
 * does" had no way to be asked of it. The argument `assetsFile.ts` and
 * `renderOptionsFile.ts` already make for themselves.
 *
 * Everything with an effect on the outside world is a parameter: the entries
 * arrive as text and the existence probe is injected, which is what lets this
 * run under `environment: "node"`.
 *
 * **It returns an outcome rather than throwing**, the arrangement
 * `caption/transcribeSession.ts` states: the caller performs it. The three
 * callers want three different things from a schema mismatch — a modal, a
 * recorded-once registry message, and a refusal that touches nothing — and a
 * throw would make each of them reconstruct which failure it was from a string.
 *
 * It returns the **whole `TimelineDocument`, tracks included.** That is the
 * one thing `readTemplateDocument` could not be reused for: a template has no
 * rows of its own so it keeps `document.elements` and drops
 * `document.tracks`, and a recovery that dropped tracks would drop the user's
 * row layout and, through `derivePriorities`, their z-order.
