/**
 * The `assetPaths.json` entry of a `.ngt` project, written and read.
 *
 * This is what makes a project folder portable: alongside the absolute paths
 * `timeline.json` has always carried, it records a **relative** path for every
 * asset that sits inside the project's own folder. Copy the folder to another
 * machine and the relative paths still name the files; the absolute ones do not.
 *
 * Same shape as `renderOptionsFile.ts` and for the same reason — `project.ts`
 * reaches for `document.querySelector`, `window.electronAPI` and JSZip within a
 * few lines of every branch, so a question like "does a template survive being
 * moved" had no way to be asked of it. Here it is a round trip between two
 * functions, one of them pure and the other pure apart from an injected
 * existence check.
 *
 * **The invariant this file defends: the in-memory document is always
 * absolute.** A relative path exists only inside the archive. That is why
 * `loadedAssetStore`, `ffmpegArgs`, the MCP tools, the preview and the export
 * needed no changes at all — the conversion happens at the two file boundaries
 * and nowhere else.
 *
 * **Why a sidecar, and not a rewritten `localpath`.** The absolute path has to
 * survive as a fallback. The most common thing a user does is move the `.ngt`
 * *alone* — onto the desktop, into Dropbox — and if the rewrite had eaten the
 * absolute path, every clip in a project that used to work would break. A
 * sidecar makes the relative path a *preference* rather than a *replacement*:
 * try relative, fall back to the absolute that was always there. Strictly more
 * projects open than before, and none that opened stop.
 *
 * **Why not a `relpath` field on the element.** Because then it is element
 * *state*: it enters `@types/timeline.ts`, flows through `normalizeDocument`,
 * is copied into every undo snapshot, becomes a decision for
 * `agent/serialize.ts`'s whitelist and for MCP output — and goes stale the
 * moment `localpath` changes, with no op maintaining it. A relative path is a
 * derived, save-time artifact, not state. Please do not "simplify" it into the
 * element.
 *
 * The schema version does not move for this. `renderOptionsFile.ts` states the
 * convention: a new entry that older files simply lack, answered by a default
 * on the way in, is not a format change. An old build ignores an entry it does
 * not know and opens the project from the absolute paths; a new build opening
 * an old project finds no entry and behaves exactly as it did before.
