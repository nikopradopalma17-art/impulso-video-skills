/**
 * What a preset tile draws, computed from the preset itself.
 *
 * The preset grid needs to show what each move *does*, and there are two ways
 * to get that: describe each one a second time in whatever the tile can draw,
 * or run the real thing and read it back. This is the second. `previewSamples`
 * builds a throwaway one-clip document, applies the **real `applyPreset`** to
 * it, and reads the result through the **real `localSampleAt`** — the same
 * function the renderer calls on every frame.
 *
 * That is the same argument `fx/fxPreviewProvider.ts` makes for rendering its
 * thumbnails through the actual compositor, and it buys the same thing: the
 * tile cannot drift from the preset, because there is nothing to drift. Change
 * a curve in `presets.ts` and the thumbnail changes with it; there is no second
 * table to forget to update.
 *
 * It is arithmetic rather than GL because these presets are transforms and
 * nothing else — no shader, no source frame — so the whole library costs a few
 * hundred `sampleBaked` lookups, done once and memoised.
 *
 * DOM-free, like the rest of `features/animation/`: the drawing lives in
 * `features/option/animationPresetBrowser.ts`, which is the only part that
 * needs a canvas.
