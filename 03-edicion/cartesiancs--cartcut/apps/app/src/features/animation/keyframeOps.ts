/**
 * Keyframe editing at the document level.
 *
 * `keyframes.ts` is to this file what `clipEdit.ts` is to `clipOps.ts`: the
 * arithmetic on one track, with no notion of a document around it. This is the
 * layer `withCheckpoint` drives, and so it is where the decline-by-identity
 * contract lives — an op that changes nothing returns the document it was
 * given, and `withCheckpoint` compares by identity to decide whether an undo
 * step happened.
 *
 * The single most important property here: authored keyframes and their baked
 * samples are written **together**, in one transform. The API this replaces made
 * baking a separate `interpolate()` call the caller had to remember, and the
 * editor's delete path forgot it — so the store kept applying an animation the
 * user had just removed.

 * to see why from the lane you were looking at.
 *
 * So the pairing is enforced here rather than in the editor. Structure — which
 * instants carry a keyframe — is shared between the lanes; only the *value* is
 * per-lane. Add, remove, and time-drag act on both; dragging the value axis
 * acts on the one being edited.
