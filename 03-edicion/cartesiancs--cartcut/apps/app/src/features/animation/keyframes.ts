 * Keyframes, as pure data.
 *
 * Everything about a keyframe track that does not need a store or a DOM lives
 * here: what a well-formed track looks like, how one is edited, how authored
 * keyframes become the baked sample array the renderer reads, and how that
 * array is sampled.
 *
 * It replaces `controllers/keyframe.ts`, which did the same work by mutating
 * the zustand snapshot in place. Because `tracks.ts#derivePriorities` spreads
 * elements shallowly, every `HistoryEntry` shared its `animation` objects with
 * the live document — so an in-place keyframe edit did not merely skip the undo
 * stack, it reached backwards and rewrote every step already on it. Pure
 * functions that return new objects are the fix, and `utils/immutable.ts` had
 * already documented this exact hazard for `trim` and `location`.
 *
 * The sampling semantics are deliberately unchanged: `sampleBaked` snaps to the
 * nearest baked point rather than blending neighbours, exactly as the old
 * `findNearestAnimationPointValue` did, ties going to the earlier point. What
 * changed is that it is O(log n) instead of a linear scan run per property, per
 * element, per frame — and that the array it searches is now guaranteed sorted.
