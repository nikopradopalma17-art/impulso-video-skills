/**
 * The common animation moves, correctly built.
 *
 * Lifted out of `optionVideo.handleClickAddAnimatePreset` so the agent and the
 * panel's own Fade In / Zoom In buttons produce the same thing. The shape of
 * the composition matters more than the numbers: `setTrackActive` then the
 * keyframes, folded into one transform, so the whole preset is one undo step.
 * Three separate writes is what it used to be, and undoing a preset was
 * impossible.
 *
 * Units differ per property and are easy to get wrong, which is most of the
 * reason to have presets at all:
 *
 *  - `opacity` is 0-100, and absolute: `fade_in` ends at 100 whatever the clip
 *    was at.
 *  - `scale` is **tenths** — 10 is unscaled, 12 is 120%. `transform.ts` divides
 *    the track value by 10. Relative, and *multiplicatively* so: a stop of 12
 *    on a clip already at 150% writes 18.
 *  - `rotation` is degrees, and relative: added to the clip's own.
 *
 * ## Why there are more than four now
 *
 * The table used to hold `fade_in`, `fade_out`, `zoom_in`, `zoom_out` and
 * nothing else, each a straight line between two values with the default soft
 * handles. That is a library of drifts: every move started and ended at zero
 * velocity, so nothing ever *landed*. The additions carry real curves —
 * `snap` for a punch, `overshoot` for a move that passes its target — because
 * an easing is the difference between a move that reads as deliberate and one
 * that reads as a slow pulse.
 *
 * The original four are untouched, values and curves both. They are what the
 * two toolbar buttons do, and changing what a button does is not a thing to
 * slip into a library expansion.

 * the same thing, and it is what the compositor uploads, so `fade_in` on an
 * effect now does what its name says.
