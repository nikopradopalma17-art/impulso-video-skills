  /**
   * Dress the host as the menu, then measure and place it.

   * **The host is the `.dropdown-menu`.** There used to be a `<ul>` inside it,
   * which meant reading `this.innerHTML` back out as a string, discarding the
   * children the parser had just built, and reparsing that string into the new
   * `<ul>`. The caller writes this markup with one `innerHTML` assignment
   * already; doing it a second time bought nothing but a second parse and a
   * second box to lay out.
   *
   * `position: fixed` rather than Bootstrap's `position-absolute`: the
   * coordinates handed in are `clientX`/`clientY`, which are viewport
   * coordinates. Absolute positioning only agreed with them by accident,
   * because `#menuRightClick` is a child of `<body>` and the document never
   * scrolls, so the initial containing block happened to line up.
   *
   * `visibility: hidden` first because the menu has to be laid out before it
   * can be measured, and measuring is what decides whether it opens up or
   * down. Without it the menu paints once at the wrong place and jumps.
   *
   * Not from a Lit lifecycle hook: this class never calls
   * `super.connectedCallback()`, so Lit's reactive update cycle does not run
   * and `updated()` would never fire.
   *
   * **The measurement waits one microtask.** The caller's `innerHTML` upgrades
   * custom elements in tree order, so this callback runs before any of its
   * rows has been upgraded or rendered. Measured here, every menu is about 0px
   * tall and always "fits" below the cursor, so it never flipped: a right-click
   * low in the timeline opened downward with `max-height` set to the few
   * pixels left, and the rows scrolled. The rows' reactions all run before the
   * `innerHTML` setter returns, and a microtask runs after that and before the
   * first paint, so the menu is measured whole and never drawn in the wrong
   * place.

 * their `ml-auto` — and the panel it opens is a `.dropdown-menu` anchored to
