/**
 * Where a popup menu goes so that it stays on screen.
 *
 * `html, body { overflow: hidden }` — see `sass/style.scss` — means anything a
 * menu pushes past the bottom of the window is not merely off-screen, it is
 * unreachable: there is no scrollbar to recover it, and in Electron there is no
 * browser chrome either. The timeline sits in the *lower* pane of a 97vh split,
 * so a right-click there almost always lands near the bottom edge. A menu that
 * simply opens downward from `clientY` is therefore cut off most of the time it
 * is used.
 *
 * The rule here is the one every OS context menu follows: open downward when
 * there is room, flip up and hang the menu's bottom edge off the cursor when
 * there is not, and only fall back to scrolling when neither side can hold it.
 *
 * Kept DOM-free so it runs in the `node` suite. `applyMenuPlacement` at the
 * bottom is the one function that touches an element, and it reads `window`
 * only when called — importing this module from a test is safe.
