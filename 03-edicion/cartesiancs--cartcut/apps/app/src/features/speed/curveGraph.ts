/**
 * The speed ramp's editing surface, without a canvas.
 *
 * Everything the graph does to a curve lives here: where a point sits on the
 * plot, which point a click is on, and what a drag, an insert or a delete leaves
 * behind. `features/option/controlSpeedCurve.ts` draws it and dispatches to it,
 * and holds no rules of its own, for the reason this codebase has no DOM test
 * environment: a rule kept inside a Lit class is a rule nothing can check.
 *
 * The same split `features/crop/` uses, and the `CropRect` suite is the model.
 *
 * ## Two things the graph must not do
 *
 * **The axes do not move while a drag is in flight.** Editing a ramp changes
 * how long the clip is, so a graph whose x axis was timeline time would resize
 * under the pointer on the frame the drag committed, and the position the
 * pointer is over would name a different instant each repaint: a feedback loop
 * with no fixed point. The x axis is **source** time, which a ramp cannot
 * change, so it stands still.
 *
 * **Points stay in order.** Every edit here clamps a point between its
 * neighbours rather than sorting afterwards, so the list handed to
 * `setClipSpeedCurve` is already sorted and a fast drag past a neighbour stops
 * against it instead of swapping two points under the pointer.
