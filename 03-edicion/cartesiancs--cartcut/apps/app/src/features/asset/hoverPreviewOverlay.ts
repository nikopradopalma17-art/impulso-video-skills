/**
 * The large preview that follows the cursor, as one element for the whole app.
 *
 * **Singleton, and that is not tidiness.** Chromium caps `WebMediaPlayer` at 75
 * per frame and each playing element costs 30-80MB — the measurement
 * `asset/decoderWindow.ts` opens with, and the reason the timeline stopped
 * giving every clip its own `<video>`. A preview element per tile would put a
 * decoder behind every file in the folder, so a directory of a few hundred
 * recordings would exhaust the cap before anyone hovered anything. One element,
 * reused, and torn down on close.
 *
 * Plain DOM rather than a Lit component: there is no reactive state here to
 * render from. The tile drives this imperatively from the effects
 * `assetHover.ts` hands it, and following the cursor writes two inline
 * properties. A `@state` field would re-render the *tile* at pointer rate, for
 * a preview that is not part of the tile's own template anyway.
 *
 * `owner` is the tile that opened it. `move` and `close` are refused from
 * anyone else, so a tile being torn down late — the directory reloaded, and
 * `repeat` keys by name — cannot close a preview a different tile has since
 * opened.
