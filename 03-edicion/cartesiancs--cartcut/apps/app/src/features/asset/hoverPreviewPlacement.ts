/**
 * How big the hover preview is, and where it sits relative to the cursor.
 *
 * Same arrangement as `menu/menuPlacement.ts`, for the same reason: the
 * arithmetic is DOM-free so it runs in the `node` suite, and the one function
 * that touches an element is at the bottom, under the banner, reading `window`
 * only when it is called. Importing this module from a test is safe.
 *
 * It is **not** `placeMenu`, though it is close enough to be worth saying why.
 * A menu hangs its top-left corner *on* the anchor and scrolls when it does not
 * fit, which is what `maxHeight` is for. A preview must do neither: it has to
 * stand off the cursor by a gap — a picture under the pointer is a picture the
 * pointer is hiding — it flips on *both* axes rather than just the vertical,
 * and it never scrolls, because a clipped preview is worse than a smaller one.
 * Teaching `placeMenu` all three would change the context menu, which is well
 * pinned and has no reason to move.
 *
 * The guards are borrowed wholesale, and deliberately: a preview placed at
 * `NaN` does not appear at all, which is a worse failure than one merely in the
 * wrong place.

 *

 * exactly the picture; the caption's height depends on how a filename wraps, so
 * the size is now written on the picture's own frame and the total measured
 * back. `placePreview` decides which side of the cursor to use by asking
 * whether the box fits, so what is passed has to be what is on screen.
