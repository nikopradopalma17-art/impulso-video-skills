 * `fetch(url).then(res => res.blob())`, which buffers the whole video into
 * renderer memory to obtain a single frame: for the 3600x2338 120fps screen
 * recordings this app is routinely pointed at, that is hundreds of megabytes
 * per tile, and a folder starts one per video in the same frame. A `<video>`
 * pointed straight at the URL range-reads instead, which is what
 * `hoverPreviewOverlay.ts` has always done. Both environments support it:
 * Electron loads `file://` directly, and the web shim's `/api/file?path=` is
 * served by Express `res.sendFile`, which answers `Range`.
 *
 * Drawing a `file://` video onto a canvas and reading it back is safe here,
 * tainting notwithstanding: it is exactly what the export does
 * (`export/renderTimeline.ts` composites `loadedAssetStore`'s `file://` videos
 * and reads the frame back with `getImageData`).
 *
 * The pure half is separated out because there is no DOM test environment in
 * this repo. `seekTargetFor` and `thumbnailSize` are where this can be wrong
 * without looking broken, so they are the part a node suite can hold.
