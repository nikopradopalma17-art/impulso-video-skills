/**
 * Importing files onto the timeline: the half that is I/O, and the half that
 * is a pure transform.
 *
 * The asset panel's original path, `AssetController.add` calling
 * `elementControl.addImage/addVideo/...`, was callback-based with no promise
 * and no returned id, which made it impossible to place several files as one
 * run. It coped by leaving the drop position on a shared `control.dropHint`
 * field for the next add to pick up, which raced the moment two files were
 * dropped together (whichever probe finished first took the hint) and left a
 * stale hint behind when one failed, so the *next* thing added anywhere in the
 * app landed at a position nobody asked for. Both are gone; this is the only
 * way media reaches the timeline.
 *
 * `mediaProbe.ts` and `mediaElement.ts` already exist to replace that path, and
 * `agent/commands/media.ts` already composes them into exactly the batch this
 * needs. What was missing was a seam the UI could reach: `commit()` lives in
 * the agent layer and reports a diff no mouse gesture wants. So the batch moves
 * here, and both callers use it — the agent through `commit`, the drop handlers
 * through `withCheckpoint`. One code path, one undo step, no shared field.
