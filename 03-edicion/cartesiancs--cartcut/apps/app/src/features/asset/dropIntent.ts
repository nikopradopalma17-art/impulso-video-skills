/**
 * What a drag carries, decided in one place.
 *
 * Two drop targets used to answer this question independently and disagree:
 * `<asset-upload-drop>` raised a full-window curtain on *every* `dragenter`
 * without looking at `dataTransfer.types` at all, and the timeline canvas
 * accepted only its own custom type. So dragging an asset out of the panel
 * raised the curtain, the curtain covered the canvas, and the drop the canvas
 * was waiting for went to the curtain instead — which then tried to read it as
 * an OS file and threw. Both halves of the feature were broken by the same
 * missing check.
 *
 * Now both consult this, so a curtain that appears and a canvas that accepts
 * cannot disagree about what is being dragged.
