/**
 * The wall, as a test.
 *
 * The whole promise of this subsystem is that extensions cannot invade the
 * app, and half of that promise is about the import graph: if any part of the
 * editor started reaching into `features/extension/`, the coupling would grow
 * quietly until "remove extensions and the editor is unchanged" stopped being
 * true. So the list of files allowed to import it is written down here, and
 * adding to it is a deliberate line in a diff rather than an import somebody
 * added while doing something else.
 *
 * The other half is the reverse direction, and it is checked too: a file under
 * `features/extension/` that reached into, say, the preview canvas would be a
 * back door into the editor's internals with no owner.

 * - `Control.ts` renders contributed tabs, panels and inspector sections.
 * - `App.ts` mounts the status strip.
 * - `elementTimelineCanvas.ts` holds the keybinding and context-menu seams.
 * - `menuCommands.ts` runs a contributed command from the app menu.
 * - the four project files carry extension data through save, load, autosave
 *   and the dirty digest.
 * - `commit.ts` and `context.ts` are the batch seam.
 * - `serialize.ts`'s caller shows an extension its own data.
 * - `commands/animation.ts` resolves a preset an extension contributed.
 * - `animationPresetBrowser.ts` shows contributed presets as tiles.
 * - `exportSession.ts` asks before exporting, `event.ts` tells afterwards.
 * - `presetRegistry` is reached the other way round, so it is not here.
