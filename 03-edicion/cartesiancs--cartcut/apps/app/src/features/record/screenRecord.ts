/**
 * The screen-record panel: a live preview of the screen, and a button that
 * records it.
 *
 * The preview runs whenever the panel is the visible one, not only while
 * recording — you have to see what you are about to capture before you commit
 * to capturing it. That distinction is the whole reason for the machinery here:
 * `Control.ts` mounts this component once at startup and only toggles `d-none`
 * on it, so `connectedCallback` says nothing about whether anyone is looking.
 * A capture started there would hold the screen — and the OS recording
 * indicator — for the entire life of the app. So the stream follows
 * `controlPanelStore.nowActive` instead.
 *
 * The recorder then records *the preview's own stream*, which is what makes the
 * source `<select>` mean anything. It previously did nothing at all: the
 * `deviceId` it set is ignored by `getDisplayMedia`, and
 * `lib/window.ts`'s `setDisplayMediaRequestHandler` hands back `sources[0]`
 * unconditionally, so every recording captured the first screen whatever the
 * dropdown said.
