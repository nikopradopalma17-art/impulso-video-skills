/**
 * What the recorder is set to capture.
 *
 * One object, persisted whole under the `record` key in `electron-store`, read
 * by the engine renderer and rendered as a tray menu by the main process.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `electron/` for two reasons. `electron/` may not
 * import `apps/app/src` — `.tsconfig`'s `rootDir` widens and the whole build
 * relocates out of `main/` (see CLAUDE.md) — and this module is pure
 * arithmetic over plain data, so it belongs where vitest can reach it.
 * `vitest.config.ts` includes `apps/app/src/**` and `electron/**` and nothing
 * else. The main process therefore treats the settings object as opaque JSON:
 * it stores it, forwards it, and builds its menu from a *model* the engine
 * sends up. No settings rule is written twice.
 *
 * The read/write split is the one `frames.ts` states for `fps` and every module
 * in this codebase follows:
 *
 *  - **`normalizeRecordSettings` guards reads.** It runs on anything that comes
 *    back from disk — including a file written by an older build, or by hand —
 *    and must never throw. Anything it cannot understand becomes the default.
 *  - **`applyRecordSettings` validates writes.** It runs once, where a value is
 *    stored, so an unusable setting is unrepresentable from then on.
 *
 * `applyRecordSettings` returns **its input, by identity**, when a patch changes
 * nothing. That is the same decline contract the timeline's pure ops have, and
 * it is what lets the tray skip rebuilding its menu on a click that re-selects
 * what was already selected.
 *
 * DOM-free.
