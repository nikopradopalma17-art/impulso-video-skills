/**
 * Auto-zoom: an input track in, a set of zoom moves out.
 *
 * This is the reason the recorder composes *after* the take rather than during
 * it. A zoom that begins when the cursor arrives is already late: the viewer
 * sees the move, then the zoom chases it. A zoom that begins half a second
 * *before* the cursor settles reads as though the camera knew, and there is no
 * way to know during a live capture. Loom and Screen Studio both record raw and
 * compose afterwards for exactly this; `LOOKAHEAD_MS` is where that decision is
 * spent.
 *
 * The shape of the answer is a small list of non-overlapping `ZoomSegment`s,
 * each with four instants (ease in, hold, ease out) rather than a value per
 * frame. Two reasons: a segment list is a few dozen numbers where a per-frame
 * track is tens of thousands (the same argument `serialize.ts` makes about not
 * returning `animation.ax`), and a segment is something a person can read in a
 * debug dump and say "that zoom is wrong" about.
 *
 * ## What this module knows, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * **When** to zoom, **how deep**, and **toward what point of the capture**. It
 * has no idea how large the project frame is or what shape it is, so it decides
 * nothing about geometry: `recordFit.ts` owns that, `zoomCamera.ts` turns these
 * segments into a smoothed path, and `zoomKeyframes.ts` writes it to the clip.
 *
 * That split is why `clampCenter` and `visibleRectFor` are gone. They derived the
 * visible window as `frame / scale`, which assumes it has the *capture's* aspect;
 * under the cover fit the clip is actually drawn at it has the *project frame's*,
 * and the two differ by exactly the amount being cropped. Two clamps with
 * different assumptions is worse than one in the right place, and the one in the
 * right place is `recordFit.ts#clampAim`, which is asserted at three aspects.
 * They also described a `VideoFrame.visibleRect` composite pass that was never
 * built and now never will be: the zoom is keyframes on the clip, so it stays
 * editable and costs no second encode.
 *
 * Coordinates in are **frame pixels of the screen capture**. The aim out is a
 * **fraction of the capture**, because that is what survives a project whose
 * frame size changes afterwards.
 *
 * Pure, DOM-free, no store.
