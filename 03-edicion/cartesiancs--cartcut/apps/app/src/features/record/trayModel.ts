/**
 * The recorder's tray menu, as data.
 *
 * The menu is the recorder's entire interface — there is no window to put a
 * settings panel in, because a window would be one more thing on screen while
 * the screen is being recorded. So every setting is a row here, and this module
 * is where the settings schema meets the menu.
 *
 * It lives on the renderer side of the boundary rather than in `electron/`
 * because it reads `recordSettings.ts`, and `electron/` may not import
 * `apps/app/src` (widening `.tsconfig`'s `rootDir` relocates the main-process
 * build out of `main/`). Main receives the finished model and renders it with
 * `Menu.buildFromTemplate` — `electron/lib/recordTrayMenu.ts` states the shape
 * from its side and explains why that duplication is the stable one.
 *
 * Ids are the whole protocol between the two halves. `parseTrayId` is their
 * only reader, so a new setting is a new id spelled in two places in this one
 * file and nowhere else.
 *
 * Pure, DOM-free.
