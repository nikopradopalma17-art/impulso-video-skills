/**
 * The null object's on-canvas gizmo — its shape and what the pointer may grab.
 *
 * A null (`GroupElementType`, born from `createNullElement`) paints nothing:
 * `isVisualTimelineElement` drops it from the paint loop and `renderElement`
 * has no renderer for it. Its `width`/`height` are a *pivot*, not a picture.
 * So the only way it can be seen or held is as chrome drawn beside the scene,
 * and this module is the definition of that chrome.
 *
 * ## Why the shape and the hit test live in one file
 *
 * The rule this repo keeps restating — `transform.ts`'s header, `hitTest.ts`'s
 * header, `previewCanvas.hitZoneAt`'s comment — is that drawing and pointing
 * must not be able to ask separately. `nullGizmoGeometry` answers "where is
 * every mark" and `nullHitZoneOf` answers "what is under the pointer", and they
 * derive every length from the same constants and the same `worldScale`. A grip
 * drawn where nothing can be grabbed is the `collisionCheck` bug over again.
 *
 * This is also why `renderControlOutline` is *not* reused here. That function
 * measures its handles in **world** pixels (`padding = 10`), while every hit
 * test measures in **screen** pixels divided by the world scale. The two
 * already disagree for ordinary clips — a known wart, visible as grips that
 * shrink when you zoom out — and a null, whose entire visible existence is its
 * handles, cannot afford to inherit it.
 *
 * ## The interior is not part of the null
 *
 * `nullHitZoneOf` answers `"none"` anywhere inside the box that is not the
 * anchor. That is the whole reason a null can be drawn all the time without
 * ruining the preview: a null's box typically *encloses its own children*, so a
 * null that answered the pointer across its full rectangle would be an
 * invisible sheet swallowing every click aimed at what is inside it — the
 * hazard `previewCanvas.isPointerTarget` used to avoid by making a group
 * unclickable until it was already selected, which was circular and meant a
 * null could never be selected at all.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free, so it runs in the `node` suite beside `hitTest.ts`.
