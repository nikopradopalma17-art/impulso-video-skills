/**
 * The arithmetic behind a move or a rotate in the preview.
 *
 * The bug this exists for: a drag mixed two coordinate spaces. `localMatrixOf`
 * places the element's *unrotated* top-left at `location` and turns it about its
 * centre, so once `rotation` is non-zero the drawn corner `(m.e, m.f)` is not
 * `location` at all. The move path captured the drawn corner as its origin, added
 * the canvas-space pointer delta to it, and wrote the sum into `location` — so
 * the element teleported by `drawnCorner − location` on the first mouse move,
 * before the pointer had travelled anywhere. A 200x100 clip at 45 degrees jumped
 * by (+64.6, -56.1). The rotate path made the same mistake about the pivot: it
 * built the centre as `drawnCorner + (w/2, h/2)`, which is a point on neither
 * quantity's terms, and grabbing the knob snapped the angle by tens of degrees.
 *
 * The fix, and the rule for anything added here: a drag is a **delta**. Take the
 * pointer's canvas-space delta into the element's parent space, add it to an
 * origin already in that space, and the two sides of the sum can no longer
 * disagree. Nothing here reads a drawn corner.
 *
 * Kept DOM-free so it runs in the `node` suite alongside the timeline modules,
 * as `hitTest.ts` and `elementPosition.ts` are.

/**
 * Where a drag should put the element, as a value fit to write into `location`.
 *
 * `originLocal` is the element's position in its **parent's** space at drag
 * start — `displayPosition`, so an animated element starts from where it is
 * drawn rather than from its static field. `originBounds` is the world-space
 * axis-aligned box of the same element at the same instant, which for a rotated
 * one is the box around its quad, not its rectangle.
 *
 * Snapping stays a canvas-space question: guides line up with the frame as the
 * user sees it. So `snap` is offered the shifted world box and its correction —
 * the difference between what it returned and what it was given — is folded back
 * into the world delta before the whole thing crosses into parent space. Passing
 * the correction rather than the snapped position is what keeps this a delta all
 * the way through.
 *
 * For an unrotated, unparented element `originBounds` equals
 * `{...originLocal, w, h}` and `parentMatrix` is the identity, so this reduces
 * to `origin + delta` exactly as before.
