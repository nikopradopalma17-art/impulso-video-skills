/**
 * What the pointer is over, in the element's own coordinate space.
 *
 * The version this replaces lived inside `previewCanvas.collisionCheck` and
 * un-rotated the pointer by hand, reading `element.rotation` directly. That was
 * a second, independent answer to "where is this element" — the exact hazard
 * the header of `elementPosition.ts` documents — and it was already incomplete:
 * it knew about rotation but not about scale, because until now nothing could
 * scale an element except its own `scale` track, which the check ignored.
 *
 * With groups, an element can be rotated *and* scaled by an ancestor it has
 * never heard of. So the un-rotation is gone; the caller inverts the element's
 * world matrix — the same matrix the renderer draws with — and hands the
 * pointer in already in local space. This function then only has to answer a
 * question about an axis-aligned rectangle at the origin.
 *
 * Kept DOM-free so it runs in the `node` suite alongside the timeline modules.
