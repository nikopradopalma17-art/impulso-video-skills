/**
 * Retiming audio to a speed ramp, by WSOLA.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * FFmpeg cannot do it. There is no `rubberband` in the bundled build, and
 * `atempo` takes only a constant factor. Its `tempo` option carries the runtime
 * flag, so `asendcmd` can step it, and that was measured before this file was
 * written: a ten-second source ramped 1x to 2x should deliver 6.9315s, and
 * stepping `atempo` delivered 6.91s in ten steps, 6.84s in a hundred and 6.77s
 * in a thousand. The error grows with the step count, because each command
 * costs the filter the tail of its current window. 21ms to 161ms of slip per
 * ramped clip is not a sync budget, so the sound is retimed here and handed to
 * FFmpeg as an ordinary input playing at 1x.
 *
 * ## Why the length is exact
 *
 * The synthesis hop is **fixed**. Output frame `k` is written at `k * Hs`
 * whatever the rate, and the analysis position it reads from is looked up fresh
 * from `sourceAt` rather than advanced by an accumulator. So the k-th output
 * sample names the analytically correct source instant however long the clip
 * runs, and no error accumulates for a longer one. The caller states
 * `outputFrames` and gets exactly that many, which is what keeps `adelay` and
 * the mix placing the clip to the sample.
 *
 * ## Why WSOLA and not a resampler
 *
 * A plain resampler is fifty lines and has no window, no search and no
 * artefacts to tune, but it moves the pitch with the rate. Today a constant 2x
 * clip is pitch-preserving in both the preview (Chromium's default
 * `preservesPitch`) and the export (`atempo`), so varispeed ramps would make
 * flattening a ramp change the character of the sound. The stretcher is behind
 * one function signature so that choice stays a one-file change.
 *
 * Knows nothing about speed curves: the caller passes the map as a closure, so
 * the suite can drive it with a constant rate and check it against `atempo`.
