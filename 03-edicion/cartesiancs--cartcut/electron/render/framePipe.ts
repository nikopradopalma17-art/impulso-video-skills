/**
 * One FFmpeg export process and the stdin pipe feeding it.
 *
 * Both export paths — the in-app `render:v2` and the HTTP/offscreen
 * `render:offscreen` — spawn the same command and stream frames the same way,
 * and each used to hold its own bare `let ffmpegProcess`. That module-level
 * singleton meant a second export orphaned the first (its stdin was never
 * ended, so it never exited) and could route frames into the wrong process.
 *
 * The session id here is what makes a stale message a no-op instead of a
 * cross-wire, and `writeFrame` is what stops the renderer outrunning the
 * encoder now that frames are raw rather than PNG-compressed.
 *
 * Like `ffmpegArgs.ts`, this deliberately imports nothing from `electron/lib`:
 * binary resolution pulls in `electron-is-dev`, which throws outside a real
 * Electron process and would make the whole module untestable. The caller
 * passes the path in.
