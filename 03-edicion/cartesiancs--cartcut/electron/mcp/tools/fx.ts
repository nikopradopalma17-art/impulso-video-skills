/**
 * Transitions and effects.
 *
 * The renderer has shipped both for a long time — 37 transition presets and 39
 * effect presets, drawn by the WebGL compositor in the preview and by the same
 * compositor on the export path. None of it was reachable from here, and
 * `CLAUDE.md` compounded that by saying transitions did not exist, so agents
 * told users a cross-dissolve was impossible.
 *
 * The two `list_*_presets` tools serve straight from main through `presetLib`,
 * the way `list_fonts` does, because the manifests are files on disk and the
 * renderer has nothing to add. Everything else crosses the bridge.
