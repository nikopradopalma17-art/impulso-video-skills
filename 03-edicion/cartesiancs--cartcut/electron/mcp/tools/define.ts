/**
 * The scaffolding every tool module shares.
 *
 * Two constraints shape this file, and both are load-bearing.
 *
 * **`registerTool`'s generics must stay erased.** `McpServer.registerTool`
 * infers the argument type of the handler from the zod shape, through the SDK's
 * zod-3/zod-4 compatibility layer. That inference is pathological here: a
 * *single* call costs about ten seconds of `tsc` and reports TS2589, and
 * seventeen of them exhaust the compiler's heap outright. Measured, not guessed
 * — erasing it takes the file from an out-of-memory crash to roughly a second.
 *
 * Nothing is lost at runtime: zod still validates every call, and the schema
 * the agent sees is unchanged. What goes away is a compile-time echo of a
 * guarantee that is enforced at the boundary anyway.
 *
 * The cast now lives in exactly one place instead of being a convention that
 * every tool module has to remember. A module receives `Registrar` as a
 * parameter type and *cannot* reintroduce the inference by accident.
 *
 * Two rules for anyone adding a tool module:
 *
 *  - Never annotate a handler parameter, and never let a `z.infer` reach a
 *    handler signature.
 *  - Avoid `z.discriminatedUnion` and deep `z.union` in tool shapes — that is
 *    the other known TS2589 generator on this path. Prefer a flat object with
 *    optional fields, and validate the combination in the handler.
