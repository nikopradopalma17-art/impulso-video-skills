/**
 * Cutting.
 *
 * Batch beats loop. `remove_ranges` takes an array because the alternative —
 * one call per cut — costs a round trip and an undo step each, and an agent
 * that has to undo forty times to take back one instruction may as well not
 * have undo.
 *
 * Times are absolute timeline milliseconds, and every one of them is snapped to
 * the project's frame grid on the way in, exactly as the mouse's are.
