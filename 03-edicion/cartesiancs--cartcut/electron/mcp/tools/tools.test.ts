/**
 * What the agent sees, pinned.
 *
 * The tool list is an API: renaming a tool silently breaks every saved prompt
 * and skill that names it, and a duplicate registration would throw only once
 * the app was running. Both are cheap to catch here.
 *
 * The committed name list is the point. A new tool is a one-line diff to it,
 * which puts the addition in front of a reviewer; a rename shows up as a
 * removal plus an addition, which is what it actually is.
