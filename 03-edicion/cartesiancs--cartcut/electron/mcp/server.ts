/**
 * The MCP server Claude Code connects to.
 *
 * Replaces the demo server that shipped before: that one exposed an `add` tool
 * and a `greeting://` resource, spoke the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport, held a
 * single module-level `transport` so a second client silently displaced the
 * first, and threw `EADDRINUSE` unhandled if its button was pressed twice.
 *
 * Streamable HTTP rather than stdio, because a stdio server is spawned per
 * Claude Code session and could never reach the editor that is already running
 * — which is the entire point. Bare `http.createServer` rather than Express,
 * because the SDK depends on Express 5 while this app uses Express 4, and the
 * transport wants the raw request anyway.
