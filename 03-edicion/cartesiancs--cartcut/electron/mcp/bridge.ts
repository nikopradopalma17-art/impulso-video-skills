/**
 * The main <-> renderer channel the MCP tools run on.
 *
 * Every editing primitive this app has — `clipOps`, `placement`, `tracks`,
 * `withCheckpoint` — lives in `apps/app/src`, and `.tsconfig` pins `rootDir` to
 * `electron/` precisely so that tree can never be imported from here (one such
 * import relocates the whole build from `main/` to `main/electron/` and
 * `package.json` stops finding its entry point). So a tool cannot edit the
 * timeline itself; it asks the renderer to, and the renderer answers.
 *
 * `ipcTimeline.get` already does a round trip of this shape and gets it wrong
 * in three ways worth naming, because they are the reasons this file exists:
 * it registers a fresh `ipcMain.on("return:timeline:get")` listener on every
 * single call and never removes one, it has no request id — so with two calls
 * in flight the first reply resolves both — and it has no timeout, so a
 * renderer that never answers leaves the caller hanging forever. An MCP server
 * is exactly the caller that makes all three fire: it is long-lived, and
 * Claude Code will happily run tool calls concurrently.
