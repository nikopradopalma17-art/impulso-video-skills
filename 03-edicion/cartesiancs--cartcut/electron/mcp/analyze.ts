/**
 * Audio analysis for the MCP tools, headless.
 *
 * The agent has always edited from words alone. It could read what was said and
 * when, and nothing else — not where the room went quiet, not how loud a moment
 * was, not where the beat fell. So "cut on the beat" was guesswork and "punch
 * in on the loud bit" was not expressible at all.
 *
 * This is the shell around `analysis/signal.ts`: decode, measure, cache. Every
 * piece of arithmetic lives in that module, which is free of ffmpeg and
 * Electron and therefore testable against signals whose answer is known by
 * construction. Nothing here does maths.
 *
 * Caching follows `transcribe.ts` exactly, and for the same reason: an agent
 * asks for the same clip more than once — once to plan, again to place — and
 * the decode is the slow part. Keyed by the file's identity rather than its
 * name, so re-exporting over a path correctly misses.
