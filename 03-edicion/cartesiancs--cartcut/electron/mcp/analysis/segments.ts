 * Pure, and here rather than in `../transcribe.ts` for the same reason
 * `signal.ts` is: that module constructs an `electron-store` and reaches
 * `electron-is-dev` at load, so nothing in it can be unit tested. The grouping
 * rule is the part with judgement in it — where a caption breaks decides how
 * every subtitle in a project reads — so it is the part that has to be cheap to
 * test.
 *
 * Times throughout are **source-file** milliseconds. Putting them on the
 * timeline is the renderer's job (`map_transcript`), because only it knows the
 * clip's trim and speed.
