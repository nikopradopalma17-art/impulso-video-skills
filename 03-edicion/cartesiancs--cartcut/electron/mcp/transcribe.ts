/**
 * Speech-to-text for the MCP tools, headless.
 *
 * The auto-caption panel already transcribes, but it does so from the renderer
 * and drives Bootstrap modals as it goes — it is a UI flow, not a function. A
 * tool call has no user watching a progress dialog, so this is the same two
 * back ends reached directly from main: the local WhisperX-shaped server, or
 * OpenAI's whisper.
 *
 * Transcription is the slow, expensive step in an automatic cut edit, and an
 * agent will ask for the same clip more than once — once to read the words,
 * again after deciding what to cut. So results are cached on disk, keyed by the
 * file's identity rather than its name, and a re-encode of the same path
 * correctly misses the cache.
