/**
 * Everything the recorder asks the main process for.
 *
 * Two callers, and they want different things. The **editor** calls `show`, and
 * that is all it ever calls. The **engine renderer** calls the rest: it drives
 * the session, and main answers with the four capabilities a renderer does not
 * have — disk, the pointer, FFmpeg, and the tray.
 *
 * Handlers answer `{ status: 1, ... }` or `{ status: 0, error }`, which is the
 * shape the rest of `electron/ipc/` uses. A rejected `invoke` would reach the
 * renderer as an opaque `Error: Error invoking remote method`, and the engine
 * has to be able to tell "the microphone is missing" from "the disk is full".
