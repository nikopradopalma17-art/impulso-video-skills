   * title would quietly turn into an empty clip the first time the OS swept
   * its temp directory, with `renderImage` drawing nothing and saying nothing.
   *
   * `userData/generated/` survives that, and survives a reboot. It does not
   * survive the project being carried to another machine — and that used to be
   * true of all media, but is not any more: `features/project/assetsFile.ts`
   * records a relative path for anything sitting inside the `.ngt`'s own
   * folder, so a project folder can now be handed to someone else intact.
   * Nothing written here is ever inside that folder, so a rasterised title is
   * specifically what a carried project still loses. That makes this the first
