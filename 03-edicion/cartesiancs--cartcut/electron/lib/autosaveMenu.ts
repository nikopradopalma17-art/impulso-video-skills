/**
 * The File → Auto Save submenu, as data.
 *
 * A **type-only** Electron import, the `recordTrayMenu.ts` arrangement, so
 * this whole module runs under vitest — the labels, the ordering, the empty
 * state and the rebuild gate are the parts with invariants and the parts a
 * mistake in is silent.
 *
 * ## One flat list, and every row names its project
 *
 * ```
 * File ▸ Auto Save ▸ Film.ngt — Today 14:25:30
 *                    Untitled (13 Sep 09:12) — 13 Sep 09:41:02
 * ```
 *
 * A ring keeps exactly one recovery point (`autosaveCache.ts#RING_SIZE`), so
 * a second level would be a submenu of one item every time — three levels of
 * nesting to reach a single choice. Flattening puts the project and the time
 * in the same row, which is the pair that identifies a recovery point.
 *
 * The **project name is never dropped**, and that is the part worth keeping
 * from the nested arrangement: a flat list of bare times is Premiere's, and
 * being unable to tell which project a time belongs to is the single most
 * confusing thing about its recovery.
 *
 * A ring holding more than one entry — a cache written by an older build, or
 * files copied in by hand — is listed as one row per entry rather than
 * hidden. The cap is a policy about what is written, not an assumption about
 * what is found.
 *
 * ## The empty state is a disabled row, never an empty flyout
 *
 * `recordTrayMenu.ts` states the rule and this reuses it as a rule rather than
 * copying the code — its leaf carries one opaque `id: string`, and a pick here
 * needs `(key, file)`. Encoding both into `"autosave:key:file"` would add a
 * stringly-typed parse as a new way to fail, so twenty lines are duplicated
 * instead.
 *
 * ## The timezone is a parameter
 *
 * The same rule `assetPaths.ts` states for `PathFlavour` and
 * `utils/platform.ts` for `isMac`, for the same reason: the host's answer is
 * the wrong one half the time, and both branches have to be coverable on one
 * CI machine.
