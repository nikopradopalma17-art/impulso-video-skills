/**
 * Serving preset folders to the renderer.
 *
 * The walk itself is in `presetScan.ts`, which imports no Electron and is
 * therefore testable; this file adds only the two things that need `app`: where
 * the built-ins live inside the packaged resources, and where a user's own
 * presets go.
 *
 * Neither half parses a manifest. `electron/` cannot import from
 * `apps/app/src` — widening `rootDir` relocates the whole build out of `main/`
 * and the app stops finding its entry point — so anything this side understood
 * about the preset schema would have to be duplicated by hand and kept in sync.
 * Understanding nothing means there is nothing to duplicate:
 * `features/fx/presetValidate.ts` owns the schema outright.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "read this file" call. Everything a preset needs is
 * read during enumeration, so the renderer never hands back a path to open and
 * there is no second entry point to traverse out of.
 *
 * `installLut` is the one *write*, and it is the same shape: it copies a file
 * the user chose into a folder of its own and writes a manifest for it, then
 * says nothing about what is inside. Importing a LUT this way rather than into
 * a registry of its own means an imported table is a preset like any other —
 * it survives a restart, it appears in search, it gets a thumbnail, and it can
 * be used as an adjustment layer — with no second code path anywhere.
