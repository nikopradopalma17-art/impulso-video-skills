 * of the render path: a module that imports `electron` cannot be loaded by
 * Vitest, and the two lists below are hand-copied across a boundary the build
 * forbids importing over. `electron/` may not import from `apps/app/src` —
 * `.tsconfig` pins `rootDir`, and widening it relocates the whole build out of
 * `main/`. So `presetValidate.ts` has its own copy of these extensions, and
 * `presetScan.test.ts` asserts the two agree, exactly as `ffmpegArgs.test.ts`
 * does for `isAudible`.
 *
 * The scanner is deliberately incurious. It reads text out of shader files,
 * resolves paths for media, and passes `manifest.json` along as a string it has
 * never parsed. Everything that decides what a preset *means* lives in the
 * renderer's validator.
 *
 * The one judgement it does make is about the filesystem: only these extensions
 * are opened. A `.js` in a preset folder is never read, which matters because
 * presets are downloadable content and the renderer that consumes them has
 * `window.electronAPI` in scope.
