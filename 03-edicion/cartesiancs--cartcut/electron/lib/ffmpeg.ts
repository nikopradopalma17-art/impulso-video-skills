/**
 * Where the FFmpeg binaries are, on this machine, for this architecture.
 *
 * Every spawn site in the app reads `FFMPEG_PATH`/`FFPROBE_PATH` from here —
 * `render/framePipe.ts`, `render/renderMain.ts`, `server/controllers/render.ts`
 * and `mcp/transcribe.ts` — so this is the only file that has to know how the
 * binaries are laid out.
 *
 * The two modes see **different shapes**, which is the one thing to get right:
 *
 *   - In the repo, `bin/` holds every target at once, one directory per
 *     platform-arch pair, because a checkout has to be able to build for all of
 *     them.
 *   - In a packaged app there is only ever one target, and electron-builder's
 *     `extraResources` copies `bin/${platform}-${arch}` *flat* into
 *     `resources/bin`. See `package.json`.
 *
 * Shipping the wrong one is not a crash — it is a silent Rosetta translation on
 * Apple Silicon, which is roughly half the export speed with nothing anywhere
 * to say so. That is what this split exists to prevent.
