/**
 * Every command the application menu can issue, as data.
 *
 * The menu bar is a second surface onto the editor's commands, and the rule
 * `features/editor/actions.ts` states for the toolbar applies here too: the
 * menu item and the keystroke must be the same behaviour, not two
 * implementations of it. So this module holds only *what* the menu offers —
 * `electron/lib/menu.ts` arranges it into menus, and the renderer's
 * `features/editor/menuCommands.ts` runs it. Nothing here imports Electron,
 * which is what lets a suite on the renderer side check that every id listed
 * below is one the renderer actually implements.
 *
 * **`rendererOwnsKey` is the load-bearing field.** A menu accelerator is
 * registered with the system and fires whatever the page does with the same
 * keystroke — a renderer `preventDefault` does not cancel it, which is the
 * lesson `menu.ts` already records about the zoom roles. So for a combination
 * the renderer *also* binds on `keydown`, sending the command from here as
 * well would run it twice: two undo steps for one ⌘Z. Those entries carry
 * `rendererOwnsKey`, and their click handler does nothing when the click came
 * from the accelerator rather than from the menu. The accelerator is still
 * registered — that is what draws "⌘Z" next to the item — but the keystroke is
 * left to the handler that already has the editor's context: which canvas has
 * focus, whether a text field is being typed into, whether the mask pen owns
 * the key.
 *
 * The rest are menu-owned: no renderer `keydown` binds them, so the click
 * handler sends them however it was triggered.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: accelerators for Space, the arrow keys, Delete and
 * Backspace. A menu accelerator is global to the window and there is no
 * per-focus escape from it, so registering Space would toggle playback every
 * time someone typed a space into a caption, and Backspace would delete the
 * selected clip instead of a character. Those bindings stay where they can see
 * the focus — `elementTimelineCanvas._handleKeydown` and
 * `Timeline._handleKeydown` — and their menu items are offered without a
 * shortcut rather than with one that would misfire. `features/editor/shortcuts`
 * is where the user reads what they are.
