/**
 * The recorder as an application: two windows, a tray, and the routing between
 * them.
 *
 * The editor opens it and then has nothing more to do with it. That separation
 * is the requirement the whole feature is shaped around — a recording must not
 * be able to stutter the timeline, and an edit must not be able to drop a
 * frame — so nothing here ever reaches into the editor window except once, at
 * the very end, to hand over a finished path.
 *
 * The engine renderer is the brain. It holds the settings, decides what the
 * tray says, and drives the capture; this module is a switchboard, and
 * deliberately understands neither the settings nor the menu (see
 * `recordTrayMenu.ts` for why that boundary sits where it does).

 * clicks so they reach the app being recorded, and still seeing `mousemove` so
 * it knows where the pointer is without having to steal it.
 *
 * **The window level has to come down with it.** An interactive window at
 * `"screen-saver"` level covering the display's whole `bounds` sits over the
 * macOS menu bar and the Dock, so it swallows clicks on the tray — the one
 * control that could turn drawing off again. `"floating"` is below
 * `NSMainMenuWindowLevel`, so the menu bar and the tray stay clickable while
 * everything else on screen is still drawn over. On Windows the taskbar is
 * topmost, so dropping out of always-on-top achieves the same thing.
 *
 * This is the third of three exits from drawing mode, and the one that does not
 * depend on the overlay's own UI working. The other two — the toolbar's Done
 * button and the Escape key — are in `overlayRoot.ts`, which explains why a
 * drawing surface must carry its own way out.

 * follows it here rather than at creation because the source is chosen after
 * the recorder opens and can change at any time while it is idle.
