/**
 * The Auto Save cache on disk: one recovery point per project.
 *
 * No Electron in here — `root` is a parameter — so `autosaveCache.test.ts`
 * drives the real thing against a real temporary directory. `autosave.ts` is
 * the thin layer that knows where `userData` is. The same split
 * `reverse.ts`/`reversePipeline.ts` and `template.ts`/`templateScan.ts` make,
 * for the same reason.
 *
 * ```
 * <root>/
 *   f-3a9c1e77b2d40915-Film/          a project saved as Film.ngt
 *     meta.json                       { v, label, anchor }
 *     20260913T142631-088Z-7f3e.ngt   the newest, and the only one
 *   s-9d41c0a2fe8b5613/               a project never saved
 *     meta.json                       { v, label, anchor: null }
 *     20260913T094102-401Z-c55d.ngt
 * ```
 *
 * A directory holds one entry, not a history — see `RING_SIZE`. "Ring" is
 * still the word for it because the shape is a ring of one: a write appends
 * and the surplus is unlinked behind it, and the code does not care whether
 * the cap is 1 or 10.
 *
 * ## Four rules, each paid for by a failure mode
 *
 * - **The filename carries the time**, zero-padded and fixed-width, so a
 *   lexicographic sort is chronological and the menu can be built without
 *   opening a single zip. `contactSheet.ts` makes the same choice
 *   ("the filename carries the range so a directory of them is readable") and
 *   `reversePipeline.ts` relies on the same sortability for its segments.
 *   A copy or a backup restore rewrites mtime and leaves the name alone, so
 *   the name is the one place the time survives.
 * - **`.part` then rename**, the `reverse.ts` idiom. A truncated autosave that
 *   the menu offers is worse than no autosave at all: it looks like a recovery
 *   point and restores nothing.
 * - **A ring with an unreadable `meta.json` is still listed**, labelled from
 *   its directory name. Never hide a recovery point because its label could
 *   not be read.
 * - **A missing root is `[]`, not a throw.** The `scanTemplateRoot` rule, and
 *   here it is load-bearing twice over: this list builds the File menu, and a
 *   throw would take the whole menu bar with it.
 *
 * ## On pruning at all
 *
 * `electron/mcp/contactSheet.ts` states a policy against sweeping — *"a tool
 * that deletes files it did not create is a worse trade than a few
 * kilobytes"* — and this module is the repo's first prune, so it owes an
 * answer. It is this: **every file this prune deletes is one this module
 * wrote, in a directory this module created, named by a pattern this module
 * mints, and matched against that pattern before it is unlinked.** That is a
 * different act from sweeping a directory it does not own. A contact sheet is
 * also a few kilobytes; a project's timeline with its baked animation lanes is
 * not, and superseding one every few seconds without deleting the last would
 * fill a disk in an afternoon.

/**
 * How many recovery points a ring keeps. **One.**
 *
 * A ring is one project's unsaved divergence, and only its newest state is
 * that. Every earlier write is superseded the moment the next one lands, so it
 * is deleted then rather than aged out — which keeps the cache the size of the
 * work outstanding rather than ten times it, and keeps the menu a list of
 * projects rather than a history nobody asked for.
 *
 * The order within `writeEntry` is what makes this safe: the new entry is
 * written to a `.part`, renamed into place, and only then is the old one
 * unlinked. There is no instant at which a project has no recovery point
 * because the replacement had not landed yet.
