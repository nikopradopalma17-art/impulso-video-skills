/**
 * Where the Auto Save cache lives, and the list the File menu draws from.
 *
 * The thin Electron half. `autosaveCache.ts` holds everything with logic in it
 * and takes `root` as a parameter, so it is tested against a real filesystem;
 * this knows `userData` and owns the cached ring list. The
 * `reverse.ts`/`reversePipeline.ts` split.
 *
 * **Main owns the directory, and the renderer never names a path inside it.**
 * `app.getPath("userData")` is not reachable from the renderer anyway, but the
 * stronger reason is the delete: a write hands over bytes and main mints the
 * filename, and a drop takes a *key* that `isValidAutosaveKey` has to accept.
 * There is no call shape in which the renderer can ask for an arbitrary path
 * to be removed.
 *
 * The list is cached because Electron builds a submenu synchronously — there is
 * no `menu-will-show` hook that can await a read — so the menu is rebuilt when
 * the cache changes rather than populated when it is opened. Every mutation
 * here goes through `refresh`, which is also the only thing that calls back
 * into the menu.
