/**
 * The recorder's tray icon.
 *
 * The recorder has no window of its own to put controls in — a window would be
 * one more thing on screen while the screen is being recorded, and the user
 * would spend the take moving it out of shot. So the tray *is* the interface,
 * and it has to survive being rebuilt on every settings change without
 * flickering out of the menu bar.
 *
 * Two things the old `createOverlayWindowTray` got wrong, both of which this
 * exists to fix:
 *
 *  - **Nothing held the `Tray`.** It was a local inside a function, so once the
 *    closure was collectable the icon could vanish from the menu bar mid-session
 *    — the documented failure mode of an unreferenced `Tray`. Here the module
 *    holds it for as long as the recorder is open.
 *  - **The icon path was relative to the working directory.** `path.join(
 *    "assets/icons/png/tray.png")` resolves against the cwd, which is the
 *    repository only when the app was started as `electron .` from inside it.
 *    Launched any other way — `open -a`, the Finder, a debugger — it resolves to
 *    nothing and the tray is a blank rectangle. Same trap `lib/preset.ts`
 *    documents, same fix.
