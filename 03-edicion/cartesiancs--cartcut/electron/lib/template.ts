/**
 * Serving template folders to the renderer.
 *
 * The walk is in `templateScan.ts`, which imports no Electron and is therefore
 * testable; this file adds only the two things that need `app` — where the
 * built-ins live inside the packaged resources, and where a user's own
 * templates go — plus the one write that removes one.
 *
 * The same division `preset.ts` makes, with one deliberate difference:
 * **installing is not here.** A `.cttpl` is a zip, and the renderer already
 * owns the app's only zip library (JSZip, in `functions/project.ts`); it also
 * has to parse and validate the archive before anything is written, since
 * `features/template/archive.ts` is where the "template.ngt at the root or it
 * is not a template" rule lives. Extracting in main would mean a second zip
 * dependency and a second copy of that rule. So the renderer extracts and
 * writes through the ordinary `filesystem:writeFile` channel, and this side
 * stays as incurious about a template as `presetScan.ts` is about a preset.
