/**
 * Where the instrument bands sit inside a frame, and how big the instruments
 * that fill them are.
 *
 * Shared by the fixture generator (which renders the instruments) and by the
 * specs (which read pixels back out of those bands), because the two must agree
 * to the pixel. A band described twice is a band that will eventually be
 * described differently in the two places, and the symptom would be a
 * frame-parity failure that looks like a renderer bug.
 *
 * Plain `.mjs` with no imports so `fetch.mjs` can load it directly under node
 * and the TypeScript side can load it through the same path without a build
 * step in between.
 *
 * Layout, top to bottom:
 *
 *     +--------------------------------------------------+
 *     | code    (frame index, one patch per bit)          |
 *     | swatch  (8 colour patches, colorimetry canary)    |
 *     |                                                  |

 *     |                        actually composites, and   |
 *     |                        the only region any        |
 *     |                        fidelity metric reads      |
