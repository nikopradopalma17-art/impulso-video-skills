/**
 * One project per scale profile.
 *
 * Timeouts here are unusually large on purpose: the `full` profile renders
 * 18,000 frames of a twenty-clip timeline through a real FFmpeg, and the point
 * of the suite is that it survives that. A timeout tuned for a normal UI test
 * would report "flaky" for the exact condition being measured.
 *
 * `workers: 1` and `fullyParallel: false` are load bearing rather than
 * cautious. `electron/render/renderFrame.ts` keeps one module-level export
 * session, so a second concurrent export is refused with "An export is already
 * running" — and two Electron instances competing for GPU and decoders would
 * make every timing-sensitive assertion meaningless anyway.
