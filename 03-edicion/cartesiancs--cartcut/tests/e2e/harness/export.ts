/**
 * Clicking Export, and waiting the way a person would have to.
 *
 * The click is genuine: `dialog.showSaveDialog` is stubbed in the main process
 * (see `launch.ts`), so `features/export/exportSession.ts#startExport` runs
 * exactly as it does for a user — the existing-file removal, the snapshot, the
 * abort controller and the frame loop all included.
 *
 * Progress is read from `exportStore` rather than scraped out of a dialog.
 * There is no dialog any more: the export button lives on the title bar, shows
 * a ring, and opens a popover only when clicked — which is what lets the user
 * keep editing while a render runs.
 *
 * Completion is taken from the IPC events, not from the UI. `PROCESSING_FINISH`
 * and `render:v2:error` are what the main process actually emits, and the second
 * exists precisely because FFmpeg can fail *after* the last frame is written —
 * a run that watched only the progress bar would call that a success. The
 * completion dialog is checked too, but as a UI assertion rather than as the
 * completion signal.
 *
 * The stall detector is the other half. An export that deadlocks — a pipe that
 * stops draining, a seek that never resolves — otherwise burns the whole test
 * timeout and reports "timed out" with no indication of where. Watching the
 * frame counter stop moving turns that into "no progress for 120s at frame
 * 8,412 of 18,000", which names the failure.
