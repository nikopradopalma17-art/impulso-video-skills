 * mangled. They are **not** the wrong-frame detector, and it is worth being
 * blunt about that because it would be easy to assume otherwise: when this
 * suite first ran against the frame-addressing defect, two thirds of the
 * exported frames carried the previous source frame and these numbers barely
 * moved — p99 and p999 sat in exactly the range they sit in now, on a correct
 * export. Consecutive frames of real footage simply look alike. The code strip
 * (`decodeFrameIndex`, zero tolerance) is what catches a wrong frame, and the
 * colour canary is what catches a wrong matrix.
 *
 * **Two measured floors, and why the second one governs.** On a synthetic
 * editor-like frame — flat background, boxes, text — the round trip through
 * this repo's encoder at the `medium` preset costs:
 *
 *     mean 1.07 | p50 1 | p99 4 | p999 11 | frac>24 0.008% | max 115
 *
 * But the scenario composites real film footage, an animated GIF and shader
 * effects, which is far closer to the same measurement over `testsrc2`:
 *
 *     mean 1.30 | p99 22 | p999 48 | max 146
 *
 * Over 94 sampled frames of the actual kitchen-sink export the distribution is:
 *
 *     mean   median 0.24 | max 2.16
 *     p99    median 2    | max 14
 *     p999   median 7    | max 51
 *     frac   median 0    | max 0.5%
 *
 * The values below clear that with margin. `mean` and `fracOver24` keep real
 * discriminating power — a wrong-range decode reads mean 9.79, so 4.0 still
 * fails it by a factor of two, and a missing element moves `fracOver24` by
 * orders of magnitude rather than by a factor. `p99` and `p999` are deliberately
 * loose: on high-detail content they are dominated by chroma-subsampling
