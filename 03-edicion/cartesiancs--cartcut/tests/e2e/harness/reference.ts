/**
 * Re-rendering a frame in the page, the way the export renders it.
 *
 * This is the reference every fidelity comparison is made against, and its
 * whole value is that it is not a reimplementation: it calls
 * `renderTimelineAtTime` with `exportElementRenderers` after
 * `loadedAssetStore.seek`, which is `features/export/renderTimeline.ts`'s frame
 * loop body with the FFmpeg pipe removed. If the app changes how it draws a
 * frame, this changes with it.
 *
 * The one thing it must not skip is `loadEntireTimeline`. The export calls it
 * before the loop; without it there are no `<video>` handles at all, `seek`
 * iterates an empty list, and every frame composites to the background colour —
 * which looks exactly like a total rendering failure rather than like a missing
 * setup call.

 * await — so when the preview has already started decoding a clip (it fires
 * `loadAssetsNeededAtTime` un-awaited on every repaint), `loadEntireTimeline`
 * resolves with that clip still missing from the cache. See FINDINGS.md #9.
 *
 * The consequence here is quiet and expensive: a reference frame rendered
 * without one of its clips does not look broken, it looks like the export drew
 * something extra. It cost a round of chasing the ticker instrument before the
 * cause turned out to be one un-decoded handle.
 *
 * So this loops until the cache holds every video the timeline references, and
 * reports both numbers so the caller can refuse to proceed on a shortfall.
