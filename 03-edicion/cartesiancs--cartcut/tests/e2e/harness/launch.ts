/**
 * Bringing the real app up, and taking it back down.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than anything else here.
 *
 * **Isolation.** The suite must be able to run while the developer has their
 * own Cartcut open, without touching their project, their settings or their MCP
 * token. `--user-data-dir` is an Electron switch, so that costs no production
 * code; `mcp_autostart: false` is pre-written into the isolated store so the
 * test instance never contends for port 9826 — which the real app would lose
 * anyway, since `startMcpServer` catches `EADDRINUSE` and carries on.
 *
 * **Fidelity.** Everything the user does, the test does through the same
 * controls. The two things standing in the way are native modal dialogs, which
 * cannot be driven from a page and would hang the run forever. Those are
 * stubbed *in the main process at runtime* rather than by adding a branch to
 * `electron/ipc/ipcDialog.ts`, so the shipping code has no idea a test exists
 * and the Render button is genuinely clicked.
