/**
 * The LUT panel, in the running app.
 *
 * Everything else about LUTs is checked without a UI — the parsers, the
 * sampler, the ops and the export all have suites of their own, and
 * `lut.spec.ts` drives the whole pipeline through the agent surface. What none
 * of them can see is whether the *panel* works, and the first version of it
 * did not: the pills that make up the sidebar mount every pane at app startup,
 * so this component rendered once inside a `display: none` pane, correctly
 * skipped painting, and was never asked again — because clicking a tab changes
 * no property Lit is watching. Eighty tiles, all blank, no error anywhere.
 *
 * So this spec asserts the thing that was broken: open the panel, and the tiles
 * have pictures in them. It is deliberately cheap — no export, no media — and
 * it is the only test in the suite that would have caught it.
 *
 * The panel is reached in two clicks: the "Fx" sidebar pill, then the "LUTs"
 * toggle inside `<control-ui-fx>`, which shares that tab with the effect and
 * transition grids. The hidden-at-startup problem above survives the move — the
 * grid mounts inside a `d-none` div and is still un-painted until the toggle
 * reveals it — so this is the same test, aimed one level deeper.
