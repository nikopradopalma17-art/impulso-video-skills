/**
 * The caption session, in the running app.
 *
 * The node suites cover what it decides: `captionProjection.test.ts` holds the
 * sequence to the same document the batch builds, `captionSession.test.ts`
 * drives the state machine over fakes, and `timelineLock.test.ts` checks every
 * gate refuses. None of them can see whether any of it reaches the app, and
 * that is this spec's whole job.
 *
 * Four claims, and each of them is a data-loss bug if it is false:
 *
 * - the edit lands on the **real** timeline as soon as a transcript does, with
 *   no Apply pressed and **no undo step recorded**;
 * - the timeline is **locked** while it is live, so a drag cannot write over a
 *   document the next keystroke is going to rebuild;
 * - the silence toggle is **exact**, because both states come from the same
 *   baseline rather than from an inverse that `removeRanges` does not have;
 * - Apply costs **one** undo step and closing costs **none**.
 *
 * The transcript is seeded straight onto the panel, so this needs no
 * recogniser, no network and no model download. Everything after that is the
 * shipping path: the panel's own event, `Control`'s wiring, the real session,
 * the real store.
