/**
 * Which side of the export loses a frame?
 *
 * The index map over a real export showed output frame N carrying source frame
 * N-1 for every ordinal where `N mod 3 === 2`, at 30fps, from a 30fps source.
 * It runs at whatever rate the active profile uses, against that profile's own
 * code strip, so the same question is asked at 120fps too.
 * That has two possible homes: the renderer drew the wrong frame, or the
 * encoder placed the right frame at the wrong index. This spec answers it by
 * cutting the encoder out entirely — it seeks and composites in the page, on
 * the export's own code path, and reads the burned-in index straight off the
 * canvas.
 *
 * Diagnostic rather than an assertion. It is here so the answer is reproducible
 * and so a regression in `loadedAssetStore.seek` has somewhere to show up.
