/**
 * The caption editor, as a window docked beside the preview.
 *
 * It used to be a `modal-fullscreen`, so it had one width and covered the app.
 * It is a window inside `#split_col_2` now, which changes what can go wrong:
 * that column already carries `overflow-x-hidden overflow-y-hidden`, so a
 * window that overruns it is **silently cut off**. There is no scrollbar, no
 * console error, and nothing a unit test can see.
 *
 * `features/window/windowLayout.test.ts` pins the arithmetic, and it passes
 * whether or not the numbers ever reach the screen. What only the running app
 * can answer is whether the CSS applies them, whether the panel inside survives
 * a few hundred pixels of width, and whether the thing is actually visible.
 *
 * ## Why this reads pixels and not just rects
 *
 * **`getBoundingClientRect()` cannot see clipping.** An element cut off by an
 * ancestor's `overflow: hidden` reports exactly the rect it would have had, so
 * every containment assertion below would pass on a window nobody can see. The
 * border check is the one that actually looks, and its negative control is
 * what stops it passing by measuring nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately cheap, in the shape of `adjust-panel.spec.ts`: no fixtures, no
 * media, no export, and no transcription. The transcript is seeded straight
 * onto the panel, which is the same idiom that spec uses to hand a clip to an
 * inspector.

 * The longest unbroken run of pixels matching `colour` along one row.

 * the right has its rules cut short; one clipped on the left has them start
 * late; one clipped off the top or bottom loses a rule entirely. All four cases
 * come out as a run whose ends are not the window's ends.
 *
 * What counts as a hit is a predicate rather than a colour, and the call site
 * passes "this pixel is not the window's own background". Matching the rule's
 * authored colour was the first draft and it does not survive contact with the
 * real thing: the app's dividers are `0.05rem`, which is 0.8px, and a 0.8px
 * line downsampled from a 2x display is a blend whose value depends on where
 * the boundary fell. Measured, the title bar's rule matched 2px of 320 that
 * way. "Not the background" is the claim that actually matters anyway, and it
 * is one the renderer cannot round away.
 *
 * The scan is bounded to the window's own columns, and that is not tidiness
 * either: `preview-top-bar` carries its own `0.05rem` rule at exactly the
 * height the title bar's sits at, so an unbounded row reads as one unbroken
 * line across the whole column. Measured, 786px of a 320px window.
