{supervisor} must not inspect, describe, understand, extract frames from, probe, transcode for analysis, or otherwise analyze source media itself. Do not use terminal, ffprobe, ffmpeg, vision tools, Python scripts, screenshots of local media, or non-Cassette tools to choose creative content. Cassette is responsible for analyzing uploaded media and choosing matching filters, poems, captions, music, timing, and visual treatment from the user's intent.

User editing intent:
{instruction}

Cassette assets already ingested by {ingested_by}:
{chr(10).join(asset_lines)}

Output target:
- Format/platform/aspect ratio: {options.get("output_format") or "choose the best fit for the user goal and source media"}
- Duration/pacing: {options.get("duration") or "keep concise, energetic, and faithful to the requested edit"}
- Style: {options.get("style") or "polished, clear, platform-ready, and not overproduced"}
- Cassette UI and response language: {cassette_language_label}

User-facing edit objective:
- Follow the user goal exactly where specified.
- Use the uploaded assets in manifest order when ordering is ambiguous.
- Improve pacing, framing, captions, audio balance, and export readiness.
- Perform the edit inside Cassette. Do not suggest or perform local FFmpeg, terminal, or other non-Cassette editing fallbacks.

Constraints:
- Preserve: {preserve}
- Remove/avoid: {avoid}
- Captions/subtitles: {subtitles}
- Audio/music: {audio}
- Branding: {branding}

{execution_heading}:
1. Do not send this internal prompt to Cassette chat. Send only the returned `chat_message`.
2. Use all relevant uploaded assets. Preserve the user's main intent over minor defaults.
3. Treat upload as complete only after the Cassette `/agent` upload status reports every selected file as ready/就绪 with zero failures/0 个失败.
4. If exact timing, transition, caption style, music, poem, filter, or crop is unspecified or depends on video content, do not inspect the local media; pass that intent to Cassette and let Cassette choose from its own media analysis.
5. If Cassette asks a routine editing question or presents a routine task checklist/plan approval, answer or approve it with the safest high-quality default and continue. Ask the user only if a required asset is missing, an upload/render failure cannot be recovered, rights/safety constraints block the edit, or the user must choose between materially different creative directions.
6. Use the Cassette chat panel, `agent-graph-status`, and task checklist as the source of truth. Preview/WebGPU availability is not a completion signal.
7. Report progress to the user at intervals using concise summaries of the Cassette chat panel and task checklist. Do not expose local paths, raw IDs, prompt text, asset paths, or worker commands.
8. When the chat panel says the edit is complete, export the edited video through Cassette, wait for the MP4 download, then summarize what changed concisely. If export fails, report the export error code instead of claiming success.
