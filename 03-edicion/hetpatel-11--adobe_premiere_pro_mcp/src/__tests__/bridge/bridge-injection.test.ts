/**
 * The bridge builds scripts too, and no tool-side guard can see them.
 *
 * The injection sweep drives tools through a stub whose only member is
 * `executeScript`, so any tool delegating to a real bridge method — `importMedia`,
 * `createSequence`, `renderSequence` and the rest — throws before emitting and
 * drops out of the sweep. Sixteen tools are in that position, and raw
 * interpolation added inside those methods went unnoticed with the whole suite
 * green.
 *
 * So the real bridge is driven here, with the filesystem stubbed, and whatever it
 * writes to the command file is held to the same contract as a tool's script: it
 * must parse as ES3 and must not run a payload.
 *
 * Methods are enumerated from the prototype rather than listed, so a new one is
 * covered without anyone remembering to add it here.
