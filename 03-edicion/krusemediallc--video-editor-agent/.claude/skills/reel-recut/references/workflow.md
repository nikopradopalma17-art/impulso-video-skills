# Step-by-step: recut a reel

## 1. Probe + understand both clips
```
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height <clip>
```
If the `claude-video-vision` plugin is available:
- `video_analyze` with `{scene_changes, silence, loudness, transcription}` on the
  reference reel — dense scene-change bursts = montage; no silence intervals + ~-14 LUFS
  = music bed throughout.
- `video_watch` with `view_sample` frames (images, ~340px) on both — read the reference's
  banner/caption/callout look, and the target's content + which segments are talking-head
  vs B-roll.

Without the plugin: extract frames (`ffmpeg -ss <t> -i clip.mp4 -frames:v 1 f.png`) and
read them, and transcribe with whisper-cli. If matching a NEW reference style, capture its
banner/caption/callout styling into the spec's `style` block (colors, font, positions).

## 2. Is there a music bed? (decides whether silence-cutting is safe)
Run `silencedetect` at a few thresholds:
```
ffmpeg -i <clip> -af silencedetect=noise=-30dB:d=0.15 -f null -
```
If the inter-phrase gaps DROP BELOW -30 dB, there's no loud bed — silence-cutting is clean.
If they don't (a loud continuous bed), cutting will glitch the music: lower `noise_db`,
rely on `manual_cuts`, or disable `silence_cut`.

## 2b. Noisy room? Cut from VAD, not from an energy gate

`silencedetect` is a flat energy gate, so a noisy source (car, cafe, fan, handheld
outdoors) defeats it *quietly*: it returns a few short spans and you ship a cut that
removed nothing. One in-car take had a -36 dB floor and `silencedetect` found 12 spans
in 118s and **none at all past 70s**.

The reliable map is voice activity, not level:

```
whisper-vad-speech-segments -f audio.wav -vm <path-to>/ggml-silero-v5.1.2.bin -vt 0.5
```
(if the GPU path aborts on your build, drop any `-ug` flag). That prints real speech
segments. Then, for each gap between them, walk each boundary outward against a 10 ms
RMS envelope while the level stays ~8-10 dB above the measured floor, so consonant tails
and breaths survive, and emit the remainder as a `manual_cuts` entry.
`scripts/plan_cuts.py` implements exactly that — feed it the wav and the VAD segments
as JSON, take its `cuts.json` into the spec's `manual_cuts`.

### Target a fixed RESIDUAL GAP, not a fixed pad

A fixed pad leaves whatever is left over, so joins end up 70–270 ms apart depending on how
much breath was in each gap — and it is that *unevenness*, not the average, that stops it
reading as one run-on take. Instead compute how much of each gap is genuinely inaudible,
then keep exactly `TARGET_GAP` of it split either side and cut the rest (what
`plan_cuts.py --gap` does). Now one number controls the whole feel:

| target | reads as |
|---|---|
| 90 ms | tightened, still breathes |
| 45 ms | the typical recut pace |
| **30 ms** | run-on, "talking over myself" (~1.8 frames at 60fps) |
| <25 ms | starts to sound spliced |

### Do NOT tighten the word gaps inside a segment

VAD merges over 120–330 ms beats *between words*, and tightening those looks like free
extra run-on feel. It is a trap. Energy cannot distinguish a beat between words from a
word-initial stop closure, a word-final fricative, or a reduced function word. On one paid
deliverable, a guard that rejected any quiet run sitting inside a word in **either** of two
transcripts still let through cuts that destroyed **"of"** in "the importance *of* quality"
(leaving "importance" audible on both sides of the join) and both ends of **"teams"** plus
the head of **"driving"**. Seam QA went PASS → FAIL with 6 HIGH findings, every one a
word-gap cut, while the flat-30 ms segment joins in the same render were clean. It was
worth 1.35s of runtime; not worth it. To go tighter, refilm at pace. (`plan_cuts.py`
keeps this pass in the code, disabled, as the record.)

**Phone raws carry STOP-TAPS at recording boundaries.** A line-by-line phone raw is many
stitched recordings — every digital-zero run ≥30ms in the audio is a stop/start boundary,
and a tap-to-stop transient often sits just before one. VAD counts the hand-reach + tap as
speech, so gap-based joins anchor AFTER the tap and it ships. Hunt three modes per
boundary: (1) stop-taps — a dip-below-floor followed by a kept spike in the 0.3s BEFORE
the zero run (do NOT search from `word_end + pad`; a tap inside the pad gets skipped —
that mistake cost a review round); (2) **kept digital-zero runs** — a boundary inside a
keep span puts literal silence in the render, and 90 ms of digital zeros reads dead in a
way room tone does not; (3) surviving start-noise after the boundary — but isolate before
cutting: one such candidate turned out to be the word "And" spoken softly. Fix: pin the
join edge to the measured word boundary, not VAD's. The same over-inclusion shows up as
"dead space" before a restarted word.

**A raw full of repeated takes is a take-SELECTION job.** When the speaker re-reads lines
to fix them, the edit is choosing the script-correct take per pair, then pause removal.
Isolate BOTH candidates to their own wavs and transcribe independently before choosing —
and beware two traps: (1) **whisper smooths repeated takes away** in a full-file pass (it
printed one clean word where the audio had a stranded attempt + restart; the double only
appeared when the RENDER was re-transcribed and scanned for doubled words — do that scan
even when the source transcript looks clean); (2) VAD can merge a discarded take's tail
into the next keep segment — split the segment at the measured energy valley.

**Isolate a VAD segment to identify a flub.** A one-word false start transcribes as
garbage in the full-file pass (whisper large-v3 once also *hallucinated a 3× repeat loop*
that did not exist in the audio). Slice each suspicious VAD segment to its own wav and
transcribe that: aborted first syllables come back as unmistakable near-words once
isolated. Record confirmed flubs as `plan_cuts.py --flubs` entries so the whole segment
is dropped.

## 3. Transcribe with timing
Use `video_watch` transcription (if available) for phrase-level, or whisper word
timestamps (see environment.md — local whisper-cli `-ojf` or the OpenAI API) when you
need exact word times — required to remove a stumble or to place a CTA callout precisely.
Save the word JSON and point the spec's `words` field at it so the QA manifest carries
remapped word timings.

### 3b. Word onsets for anything word-synced: do not trust one full-file pass

If the cut feeds a motion-graphics comp (hits and cards anchored on words), or the seam QA keeps
flagging "clipped word" on silence-origin cuts that an isolated re-probe hears intact, the word
timings are the problem, not the cut. Measured on a generated talking head with dead-clean pauses:

- a full-file **whisper.cpp large-v3** pass smeared word onsets INTO the surrounding silence
  ("ByteDance" placed 0.7 s inside a silencedetect span), so the manifest lane reported four
  clipped words that were all false positives;
- transcribing each 1-2 s keep span in isolation was worse: whisper.cpp token offsets collapse
  to the segment start on short clips and it hallucinated words ("and many more");
- **OpenAI whisper-1 `verbose_json` word times** ran a consistent ~0.15 s late and never smeared
  into silence; and the **silencedetect edges are the true onset of every phrase-initial word.**

`scripts/map-words.py <project-dir>` combines the two: cloud words shifted by the measured
lateness, assigned to the keep spans from the qa-manifest, the first word of every span snapped
to the span edge, words that only exist past the media end dropped. It writes `words-cut.json`
(cut time, what a comp's `W("word")` reads), `words-master.json` / `v916-edl.json` /
`edl.json` (the shapes `qa:video --lane hyperframes` wants) and `source-words-accurate.json`
(point the spec's `words` at it and regenerate the manifest with `--qa-manifest-only`). On the
proving run the manifest lane went from 4 HIGH to 0 issues on 22 cuts with no cut touched.

## 4. Author the spec (the craft)
Copy `assets/spec.example.json`. Captions are the main work:
- ~2s per card, <= ~6 words, <= 2 lines.
- **Clean them**: drop filler ("like", "um"); fix transcription errors (whisper mangles
  product and brand names — learn the user's recurring ones and fix on sight). Captions
  are paraphrase-clean, not verbatim.
- Apply the user's house copy rules (the example brand bans em dashes in on-screen
  copy — use periods/commas; ask for or learn your user's equivalents).
- Banner: 1-2 SHORT uppercase lines, parallel to the reference reel's hook.
- Callouts: one for an aside or the comment-keyword CTA; set `suppress_captions` for the
  overlapping caption indices so the same words don't show twice.
- Set `manual_cuts` for stumbles/bad takes from the word timings.
- Set the `style` block to the user's brand (or the captured reference styling).

## 5. Render
```
python3 scripts/build_reel.py spec.json
```
(disable the agent sandbox if ffmpeg dies under it). It prints the new duration + counts
and dumps `<spec>.qa-manifest.json` next to the spec — regenerate anytime with
`--qa-manifest-only`.

## 5b. Validate every seam before you ship

Cheap checks that have each caught real defects:

```bash
# 1. per-cut: does applying this cut change the words at the seam?
WHISPER_MODEL=<ggml-model> python3 scripts/verify_cuts.py cuts.json --src raw-audio.wav
# 2. the whole render: re-transcribe the OUTPUT and read it end to end as prose;
#    scan for doubled words (the fingerprint of a surviving discarded take)
```
The manifest lists every cut with source + output times — use it to spot-check each seam
in the render (`ffmpeg -ss <out_t - 1> -t 2` slices, transcribed in isolation).

Interpreting a flagged seam:
- If the flagged word is heard intact when the seam is isolated and re-transcribed, the
  flag is a false positive from loose word timings (transcript-timing overshoot) —
  common for `silence`-origin cuts, which removed *measured* silence.
- "Word NOT heard at the seam" on an isolated slice is real — **with one exception**:
  when the flagged word is the first word of an INTENTIONALLY DISCARDED take whose loose
  cloud word-start overlaps the seam, "not heard" is exactly what you want. Before acting
  on a confirmed clip at a take boundary, check the energy envelope and isolate the KEPT
  side of the seam.
- **Never act on a full-file transcript alone.** whisper large-v3 has hallucinated a 3×
  repeat loop and 10 invented words in a stat line *and* dropped an "of" that was
  genuinely present — all on one project. Any suspicion, re-transcribe that region in
  isolation before you change a cut.

Fix by editing the spec (nudge a cut ≤500ms, retime a caption, remove a duplicate),
re-render, re-verify; stop after 3 rounds and surface what's left to the user.

### 5c. Stutters that every transcript smooths over (learned 2026-09-28)

A blown take with two or three ~60 ms false starts ("of a f-, f-, phenomenon") passes `verify_cuts.py`,
both QA lanes and a full re-transcription of the render: Whisper folds the bursts into one long vowel.
Three checks catch it, in this order:

1. **The tell in the word list:** a function word ("a", "the", "of") with a duration > 0.6 s in the
   cloud transcript is a smoothed false start. Scan every project's word JSON for it before the cut.
2. **The anatomy, not the transcript.** Per 10 ms window compute energy < 1 kHz and 3–8 kHz. A vowel is
   loud low-band; a false start of the next word is a *fricative burst (high band) followed by a short
   vowel*. The article you must keep is the voiced tail of the previous word; the cut runs from the end
   of that tail to the true onset of the next word.
3. **Whisper is not a tiebreaker.** Two candidate cuts that differ by one syllable transcribe
   identically on isolated slices. Decide from the band read (and the reviewer's ear), then verify the
   seam on the rendered file by isolated re-transcription and a 20 ms envelope.

Also from the same edit: after `plan_cuts.py`, a second pass on the RENDERED cut that walks out from
each join while the 5 ms RMS stays under floor + 9 dB and keeps 15 ms a side turns 100–165 ms of
"air" the VAD counted as speech into the 30 ms house pace (`tighten-seams.py` pattern; generic version
belongs in `plan_cuts.py --reclaim-db`).

## 6. QA without a video player
- Extract frames: `ffmpeg -ss <t> -i out.mp4 -frames:v 1 q.png`, then read them.
- Pixel-check a callout/banner: sample its band for the spec's `accent_color`.
- Stumble/CTA edits: re-transcribe that region of the OUTPUT and confirm the words.

## 7. Deliver
Send a phone-viewable link (review page or file host — see environment.md); keep the
original raw untouched.

## Common follow-up requests and how to handle them
- "remove the callout / the zooms" -> delete from spec (this build has no zooms by default).
- "tighter cuts / talking over myself" -> enable silence_cut, lower edge/min_pause (or
  re-plan VAD cuts at a smaller --gap).
- "fix where I trip over my words / repeat myself" -> whisper word times -> add a
  `manual_cut` over the duplicated take; keep the cleaner one.
- "add a callout when I say X" -> whisper word times for X -> callout window + suppress
  the duplicate caption.
- "change the banner / wording" -> edit `banner` and re-run.
