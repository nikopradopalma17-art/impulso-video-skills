/**
 * video-qa — shared types.
 *
 * Design rules (from a shipped branded edit's post-mortem + the QA plan):
 * - A rendered .mp4 is an AUDIO + VIDEO artifact; every layer treats both streams
 *   as first-class.
 * - Issues anchor to STABLE manifest event ids (lane-native keys), never to raw
 *   timestamps, so issue tracking survives re-renders that shift the timeline.
 * - The manifest describes edit INTENT (emitted by the editor at build time),
 *   never derived by analyzing the rendered output.
