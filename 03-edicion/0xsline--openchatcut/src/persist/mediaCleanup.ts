// Asset reference inventory and cleaning. Solve two things:
// ① When deleting a project, cascade delete assets - but only delete files that are "no longer referenced by other projects" (copied project sharing
// Assets with the same name, reference counting ensures that they are not accidentally killed);
// ② Unowned asset cleaning - test/deleted project files left in /media/uploads/, click "All Project Documents"
// (Including soft deletion, which can be restored and counted as a reference) Find out the reference set and delete it after confirmation.
// Disk deletion goes through DELETE /upload (single segment security name on the server side); IDB media cache is cleared synchronously.
// R2 cloud objects are deliberately not moved: local deletion is reversible (it can still be retrieved when returning to the source).
