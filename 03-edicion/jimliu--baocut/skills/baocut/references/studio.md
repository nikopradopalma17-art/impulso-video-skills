# Subtitle Studio preview page

`bin/baocut` below means `"$BAOCUT_SKILL_ROOT/bin/baocut"`. This file covers
operating the browser preview; data structures, rendering algorithms, and
defaults live in code and are not duplicated here.

The page code is served live from this skill's `templates/` directory by
`bcut serve`; it is never copied into projects. After a skill update, a
browser refresh is enough to load the new page.

## Serving a project

Projects created with `project create` in the shared projects library are
registered globally and served automatically at `<url>/projects/<id>/` (see
[workflows.md](workflows.md)). `<url>/projects/` itself is the "My projects"
list page — the same single-page app, showing every project the server can see
as cards or a table with search, status, and a video thumbnail. The page's
sidebar lists the same projects, so once a project is registered or mounted the
user can switch to it from any project page. For a project outside the library,
mount it explicitly:

```bash
bin/baocut serve --background
URL=$(bin/baocut serve --status | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["url"])')
curl -fsS -X POST "${URL}__bcut/mount" -d '{"id":"<name>","path":"<abs project path>"}'
# page = ${URL}<name>/
```

## Service reuse

- All sessions share one server instance; never start a per-project or
  per-session server, and never hardcode a port — discover the real URL via
  `serve --status`. Open pages through that URL, not `file://`.
- When the page is unreachable, check `serve --status` first. If
  `running:false`, run `serve --background`: it starts a persistent server,
  waits for the health check, reuses a live same-root server on repeat runs,
  and restores prior mounts after a restart. Do not substitute shell `&` or
  `nohup`, and do not kill a port's owner without confirming the process.
- At every Agent task continuation, after an explicit model download, and
  before final handoff, run `serve --background` idempotently, re-read
  `serve --status`, and require HTTP 200 from the current project URL. If the
  port changed, discard the stale URL and report the newly discovered one.
- If `mount` returns 409 (id already used by another path), pick a different
  id instead of taking over an existing mount.
- Prefer reusing an existing browser tab with the same URL; without a built-in
  browser, report the URL to the user instead of opening an external one.

## Data boundary

- The project stores only Studio data, never page code.
- `transcript.json` and generated Studio data are CLI-managed; do not
  hand-edit them.
- Prefer `transcript find` / `transcript replace` for deterministic text
  lookup and replacement. Use `--scope all` for a lexical replacement across
  cue content and speaker names, and protect mutations with the `total` from
  `find` via `--expect`. Do not open the page merely to search or type text.
- Page edits live in a project overlay and are written back with
  `studio apply`.
- A newly transcribed project may show an "Initial grouping" badge. Those
  paragraph boundaries are a provisional Studio projection, not a second
  transcript truth; any paragraph edit promotes the same boundaries atomically
  before applying the edit, and one undo reverts both actions.
- Styles are a display projection. The comma/period option also applies to
  SRT/VTT and MP4 for every language, but never rewrites the transcript,
  JSON, or Markdown exports. By default the preview and subtitle exports hide
  plain commas and periods in both the original and the translation while
  keeping question marks, exclamation marks, ellipses, and punctuation inside
  data tokens; switch "commas / periods" to visible in the style panel when
  the user wants verbatim punctuation. The style panel is not a tab — it slides
  over the side pane, opened from the stage toolbar's subtitle-style button or
  the `/style` deep link.
- When the page and the CLI work at the same time, the CLI's conflict and
  skip reports are authoritative.

## Stage selection and overlay elements

- Clicking the canvas is a transport control first: while playing, a click
  pauses and opens a two-second selection window; a second click inside that
  window selects the subtitle. Clicking a paused stage with nothing selected
  just resumes playback. To select the on-screen subtitle directly, press the
  stage toolbar's subtitle-style button — it selects the subtitle and opens the
  style panel in one step, and the selection survives the playhead crossing cue
  boundaries. Escape clears the selection.
- The Transcript and Subtitle tabs always preview the original text only; the
  bilingual/translated/original display mode belongs to the Translate tab.
- Text, image, and watermark overlays live on the timeline, not in the
  transcript. Add them from the transport bar's "Add" menu, or from the stage
  toolbar's Watermark button for a whole-video watermark. Selecting one opens
  its inspector (watermarks open the watermark panel), where content, time
  window, transform, position, text style, and tiling are edited; the timeline
  shows one row per overlay lane, and blocks can be dragged or trimmed. Page
  and CLI write the same element truth and the same project history — the CLI
  equivalents are in [elements.md](elements.md). B-roll video overlays are not
  available on the page yet.

## Applying page edits

```bash
bin/baocut studio apply "/path/demo.bcut" --json
```

Apply pending page edits before running any polish, translate, or align
stage. After applying, read the JSON output's applied items, skip reasons,
and suggested actions; when an edit invalidates later AI results, re-run only
the affected stages as reported — never patch generated files directly.

For a non-interactive replacement, use the shorter CLI transaction instead:

```bash
bin/baocut transcript find "/path/demo.bcut" "old" --scope all --json
bin/baocut transcript replace "/path/demo.bcut" "old" "new" \
  --scope all --expect 2 --json
bin/baocut transcript find "/path/demo.bcut" "old" --scope all --json
```

`replace` updates `words[]` through the Transcript data model, records project
history, refreshes Studio, and fails without writing when `--expect` no longer
matches. Browser editing is reserved for an explicitly interactive or visual
operation that has no CLI equivalent.

## Page requests

Users may submit pending requests from the page. Handle only requests the
user explicitly initiated that are still pending; clear them through the
project's existing page/CLI flow when done. Do not fabricate requests or
bypass the CLI to rewrite the transcript.

## History and recovery

Prefer the page's version history — the clock button in the Transcript panel's
tool row — to restore a version, then run:

```bash
bin/baocut studio sync "/path/demo.bcut" --json
bin/baocut check "/path/demo.bcut" --json
```

Never restore, undo, or redo without an explicit user instruction.

## Video export from the page

The title bar's Export menu ("Export video · MP4") calls the current
`bcut serve` instance, burns the page's effective subtitle overlay, styles,
and animations into the project's source video, and downloads the result. The
CLI equivalent:

```bash
bin/baocut export "/path/demo.bcut" --to mp4 --json
```

Omitting `--mode` keeps the page's current original/translated/bilingual
mode; overriding a translated mode still requires `--lang`. Plain
comma/period visibility follows the page's current display option. MP4 export
uses the native media frameworks on macOS 14+ and Windows 11 (no libass
required); a single continuous main media exports directly, while cuts, speed
changes, or multi-segment/multi-source main tracks are first flattened with
the `ffmpeg` found on PATH. The first Linux release returns `unsupported`.

## Troubleshooting

- Page does not open: re-check the server and the project mount per
  "Service reuse".
- Media unavailable: check the media path with `project show`. For URL
  inputs, rerun the original `transcribe "<URL>" --project …` to reuse or
  complete the download. For a moved local file, relink it through BaoCut's
  project media entry point; do not hand-edit `project.json`.
- Timeline thumbnails missing: thumbnails need `ffmpeg` on the serve
  process's PATH (waveforms do not — they fall back to a pure-Rust decoder
  automatically); derived caches live in `<project>/cache/` and can be safely
  deleted — the page rebuilds them. An old serve process lacks these
  endpoints; restart serve to pick up the new binary (the page falls back to
  gradient placeholders on an old server, which is not a fault).
- Page content stale: run `studio sync`, then re-check the page.
- Page remains at “syncing” after a short edit: first restart the current
  `serve --background` generation and refresh. Current builds exclude
  synchronous page transactions from the long-task registry, so a persistent
  sync job indicates an old server process or a real active CLI flow.
- Edits not applied: run `studio apply` and read the skip reasons in the
  JSON.
- Video export fails: verify `project.json.media.path` still points to a
  readable video; for cuts, speed changes, or multi-segment/multi-source main
  tracks also confirm `ffmpeg -version` works on PATH. Audio-only projects
  cannot export MP4.
- AI stage issues: fall back to `project show`, `check`, and each command's
  returned `next` suggestions.
