# Naive Video Learn

Turn explicit feedback into a testable project-local rule.

Resolve `<skill_root>` by locating the installed `talking-head-video-pipeline/SKILL.md`; do not assume the user's current directory is the skill directory.

## Preconditions

- The user must clearly confirm the preference.
- The rule must be observable and testable.
- Read `references/self-iteration.md`.

## Workflow

1. Capture a short faithful quote or paraphrase.
2. Classify scope as `project`, `profile`, or `product-candidate`.
3. Default ambiguous feedback to `project`.
4. Write the lesson to `VIDEO_LESSONS.md` using the protocol format.
5. If the lesson is an active style rule, update only the matching field in `DESIGN.md` and state.
6. For `profile` scope, initialize the private local profile when needed and add only the sanitized confirmed rule:

   ```bash
   python3 <skill_root>/tools/profile.py init
   python3 <skill_root>/tools/profile.py add-rule --stage <stage> --rule <sanitized_rule>
   ```

7. If it supersedes an older rule, mark the older lesson as superseded and keep only the active rule in `DESIGN.md`.
8. Never copy private context into this skill repository or GitHub automatically.

## Product Candidates

For a generic hard correctness issue, record only a sanitized description in the user's project and tell the maintainer it is eligible for review. Publication remains a separate maintainer action.

## Completion

Show the exact confirmed rule, its scope, and the file updated.
