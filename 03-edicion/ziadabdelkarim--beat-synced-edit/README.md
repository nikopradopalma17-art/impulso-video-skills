# Beat-Synced Edit — Claude Code Automation

Automatic beat-synced video editing.

Feed it a song and raw footage. It analyzes the beats, maps the energy, tags every scene, and cuts a ready-to-post edit — zero manual editing.

## Demos

<!-- EMBED STEP (once, in GitHub's web editor): click the pencil on this README,
     then for each cell below: select the PASTE-VIDEO-HERE line and drag the
     matching file from examples/ onto it. GitHub uploads the video and inserts
     a user-attachments URL that renders as an inline player. Keep the blank
     lines around each URL — without them the player won't render. -->

## Two ways to use it

### 1. Pure CLI — deterministic, no AI

Run the four stages yourself. Same inputs, same edit, every time.

### 2. Claude Code skill — conversational

The repo ships a skill at `.claude/skills/beat-sync-edit/SKILL.md`. Open this folder in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and describe the edit you want:

> "cut my footage to the chorus, white flash on every drop, space the cuts out so the shots breathe, then make it 9:16"

Claude runs the same pipeline and layers ffmpeg effects at beat-accurate timestamps — white flashes, stretch punches, hue shifts, RGB split, speed ramps, shakes, color grades. The full effects cookbook lives in the skill file.

In conversation you can also dictate:

- **Aspect ratio** — 9:16 vertical, 1:1 square, stacked over-under, or leave it 16:9
- **Cut density** — "a cut on every beat" vs "spaced out, let the shots breathe"
- **Hue / tint by reference** — point Claude at any other video on your machine ("grade it like this one") and it will sample frames from the reference and build a matching color grade; with the Claude-in-Chrome extension it can even study a look from a video on the web

## How it works

```
song.mp3  ──►  beat_map.py    ──►  beats, energy curve, peaks/valleys (JSON)
clips.mp4 ──►  clip_tag.py    ──►  scenes tagged by motion/energy/brightness (JSON)
both      ──►  plan_edit.py   ──►  edit decision list: which clip hits which beat
EDL       ──►  render_edit.py ──►  final MP4 (extract → concat → mux audio)
```

| Stage | What it does |
|---|---|
| `beat_map.py` | librosa audio analysis — beat timestamps, tempo, energy over time, peaks/valleys, best highlight segments |
| `clip_tag.py` | PySceneDetect scene detection + per-clip motion/energy/brightness scoring; `--thumbs` exports a labeled contact sheet |
| `plan_edit.py` | the matcher — high-energy clips land on energy peaks, calm clips on valleys, with anti-repetition, source spacing, and black-frame filtering |
| `render_edit.py` | ffmpeg assembly; `--overunder` emits a stacked 960×1080 variant |
| `vertical_style.py` | fits 16:9 output into 9:16 with a stylized squeeze + grade for TikTok / Reels / Shorts |
| `flash_montage.py` | the white-flash montage template — 1:1 edits from stills and/or video clips with `fadewhite` transitions, punch-ins, and handheld sway (see below) |

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # ffmpeg must be on PATH (brew install ffmpeg)

python3 beat_map.py song.mp3
python3 clip_tag.py footage.mp4 --thumbs
python3 plan_edit.py song_beatmap.json footage_clips.json --html
python3 render_edit.py footage_edl.json -a song.mp3 -v footage.mp4
```

## Controlling the cut

All creative control lives in `plan_edit.py`:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--beat-stride N` | Cut density. `1` = a cut on every beat (default). `2`+ keeps every Nth beat — fewer, longer cuts that breathe, for slow or contemplative footage |
| `--full` | Edit the whole song instead of the best-scoring segment |
| `--segment 2` | Use the second (or third) best highlight segment |
| `--exclude '1,6,0-30'` | Drop clips by id or source time range |
| `--lead '2:18,5'` | Force the opening cuts, in order |
| `--pin '8=138,peak2=22'` | Pin a clip to a specific beat, peak, or valley |

A useful convention when comparing densities: render both and suffix them `_beat-full` and `_beat-thinned`.

## White-flash montage template

The square demo above is a montage: each scene holds for a couple of beats (about 2.8 seconds in the demo), then blooms into the next through a white flash. You make one by describing it.

Open this folder in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), point it at your song and a folder of clips or photos, and say what you want:

> "make a white-flash montage from these six clips — punch in on each animal, flashes about a second long"

> "use still frames instead of the moving clips, and give them a little handheld shake"

> "quicker flashes, and end it on a fade to white"

Claude picks the moments from each clip, frames each subject, times the scenes to your song, and renders the finished 1:1 video. Scenes can be video clips or still photos — stills get a subtle handheld sway so they don't look frozen — and the flash length is whatever you ask for.

Prefer the command line? `python3 flash_montage.py --seq seq.json --audio song.wav --out montage.mp4` — the `seq.json` format is documented at the top of the script.
