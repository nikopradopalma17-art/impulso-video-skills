name: beat-sync-edit
description: Turn a song + raw footage into a beat-synced edit. Runs the four-stage pipeline (beat analysis, scene tagging, EDL planning, render) and applies user-described ffmpeg effects — white flashes, stretch punches, hue shifts, speed ramps — at beat-accurate timestamps.

# Beat-Sync Edit

Drive the deterministic pipeline conversationally. The user describes the edit
they want ("cut my footage to the chorus, white flash on every drop, make it
9:16"); you run the stages, apply effects, and deliver the file.

## The pipeline (run in order)

```
python3 beat_map.py <song>                       # beats, energy, peaks/valleys → <song>_beatmap.json
python3 clip_tag.py <footage> --html --thumbs    # scenes + motion/energy tags → <footage>_clips.json
python3 plan_edit.py <beatmap> <clips> --html    # energy-matched EDL → <name>_edl.json
python3 render_edit.py <edl> -a <song> -v <footage>   # final MP4
python3 vertical_style.py <mp4>                  # optional 9:16 squeeze + grade
```

- Read the beatmap's `peaks`/`valleys` and the EDL before adding effects —
  effects belong ON beat timestamps, not at arbitrary times.
- `plan_edit.py` overrides: `--exclude '1,6,0-30'`, `--lead '2:18,5'`,
  `--pin '8=138,peak2=22'` — use them when the user dislikes a cut.
- `plan_edit.py --beat-stride N` — cut density. 1 = a cut on every beat
  (default); N>1 keeps every Nth beat: fewer, longer cuts that breathe, for
  slow/contemplative footage. Naming convention for variants:
  `<name>_beat-full` (stride 1) vs `<name>_beat-thinned` (stride 2+).
- `plan_edit.py --full` uses the whole song instead of the best segment;
  `--segment 2|3` picks the second/third-best highlight segment.
- `render_edit.py --overunder` emits the stacked 960x1080 "3D" variant.

## The white-flash montage template (separate edit style)

When the user asks for a MONTAGE — a 1:1 sequence of held shots/stills with
white-flash transitions ("white flash between each clip", "photo narrative",
"meme montage") — use `flash_montage.py` instead of the beat pipeline:

```
python3 flash_montage.py --seq seq.json --audio <song> --out out.mp4 --flash 1.0
```

Author the seq.json yourself from the user's description: one item per shot,
`{"video": path, "start": t, "dur": d}` or `{"image": path, "dur": d}`, with
`zoom`/`cx`/`cy` to punch in on each subject (LOOK at a frame first to place
cx/cy), `stretch` for width hits, `motion: "sway"` for handheld feel (default
on stills, off for videos). Set `dur` to a beat-multiple of the song's tempo
(from beat_map.py) so flashes land musically — e.g. 4 beats per slot. Iterate
by editing the seq.json, not by rebuilding commands.

## What the user can ask for (translate words → workflow)

- "punchier / more cuts" → `--beat-stride 1` (default), or lower clip_tag
  `--threshold` for finer scenes
- "calmer / spaced out / longer scenes / let shots breathe" →
  `--beat-stride 2` (or 4 for very slow footage); when comparing, render both
  and suffix the outputs `_beat-full` / `_beat-thinned`
- "start on the best moment" → `--lead` with the highest-energy clip
- "make it vertical / TikTok-ready / 9:16" → vertical_style.py after render;
  "square / 1:1" → center-crop with ffmpeg (`crop=ih:ih,setsar=1` + scale);
  "stacked / over-under" → `render_edit.py --overunder`
- **Reference videos — take ONLY what the user asks for.** A reference is not
  a request to clone the whole look. Extract 3-5 frames
  (`ffmpeg -ss <t> -frames:v 1`), LOOK at them, then match just the named
  aspect(s): "this tint" → hue/cast only (`hue`, `colorbalance`); "this
  contrast" → `curves`/`eq` only; "how washed out it is" → saturation only;
  "the way it cuts" → cut rhythm/density, not color at all; "that flash
  effect" → just that effect from the cookbook. If they say "make it look
  like this" without naming an aspect, ASK which parts they mean (color?
  contrast? pacing? effects?) before matching more than one. Show a
  confirmation frame before final render. If the reference is on the web and
  Chrome tools are available, study it there the same way.

## Effects cookbook (apply with ffmpeg per segment, then re-concat)

Apply to individual extracted segments between the extract and concat steps
(re-encode the segment with `-vf "<filter>"`), or to the final file. Time
effects to beat timestamps from the beatmap.

| User says | ffmpeg filter |
|---|---|
| white flash (on the beat/drop) | `fade=t=in:st=0:d=0.07:color=white` on the segment starting at that beat |
| black dip | `fade=t=in:st=0:d=0.07:color=black` |
| stretch / punch-in | `scale=iw*1.15:ih*1.15,crop=iw/1.15:ih/1.15,setsar=1` (hold ~2 frames, then normal) |
| horizontal stretch hit | `scale=iw*1.25:ih,crop=iw/1.25:ih,setsar=1` |
| hue shift / psychedelic | static: `hue=h=60` · animated: `hue=h='mod(t*180,360)'` |
| RGB split / glitch | `rgbashift=rh=6:bh=-6` |
| speed ramp | `setpts=0.5*PTS` (2x) · `setpts=2*PTS` (half speed; add `minterpolate` for smoothness) |
| shake | `crop=iw-20:ih-20:'10+8*sin(t*40)':'10+8*cos(t*37)'` |
| strobe invert | `negate=enable='lt(mod(t,0.25),0.04)'` |
| dreamy glow | `gblur=sigma=8,blend=all_mode=screen,all_opacity=0.35` (via split) |
| grade: warm | `colorbalance=rm=.12:bm=-.08` · cool: `colorbalance=bm=.12:rm=-.06` |

Rules of thumb: flashes/punches on energy PEAKS only (over-flashing reads
amateur); one signature effect per edit + one grade; always `-pix_fmt yuv420p`
and `setsar=1` when re-encoding segments so concat stays valid.

## Workflow when the user asks for an edit

1. Run beat_map + clip_tag (with `--thumbs`; view the contact sheet to know
   the footage).
2. plan_edit → review the EDL against their description; apply overrides.
3. render_edit → if effects were requested, re-extract the affected segments
   with filters at the right beats, re-concat, re-mux audio.
4. Optional vertical_style for 9:16. Deliver the file path + one-line summary
   of cut count, duration, and effects used.
