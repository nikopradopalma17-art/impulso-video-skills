# Capability Package Completion

> Archived 2026-08-28: new native capability packages are frozen, so this completion template is no longer an active workflow template.

Publish only redacted summaries. Omit credentials, tokens, user project names, private paths, and other sensitive values; retain full machine evidence locally.

## Identity

- Package PR:
- Parent Epic:
- Child Issues (optional):
- Exact candidate SHA:
- Merge / clean-main SHA:

## Per-Issue disposition (when child Issues are used)

| Child Issue | Public tool(s) | Acceptance result | Evidence reference | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| # |  | pass / fail / deferred |  | close / keep open |

## Public MCP evidence

- Full redacted package evidence bundle/reference:

Provide one row per included public tool. Summarize request/response shapes here; keep full structured envelopes in the linked package evidence.

| Public tool | Request shape / scenario | Typed outcome | AE state verified | Evidence reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Real After Effects state

- Formal AE path/version/build:
- Disposable fixture:
- Before state:
- After state:
- Restart/reconnect state:

## Native provenance and audit

- Core / CEP / native / protocol source commit:
- Native capability and engine:
- Host/session identity:
- Audit request/operation ID:
- Request digest:
- Postcondition digest and verification:

## Writes, Undo, and recovery

| Tool / operation | Before | After | Undo available | Undo executed | Undo state verified | Uncertain-failure reconciliation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Review and CI

- Independent review rounds:
- Blockers fixed:
- Follow-ups created:
- Out-of-scope findings:
- Required CI status for each frozen candidate SHA:

## Candidate and clean-main hardware

- Candidate T5 result and evidence:
- Clean-main rebuild/reinstall identity:
- Clean-main T6 result and evidence (every included public tool; accepted optional child Issues; every write Undo):
- Canonical plug-in mapping:

## Remaining risks

| Risk | Classification | Follow-up Issue | Why it does not block this package |
|---|---|---|---|
|  | P1 / P2 / P3 / out | # |  |

## Efficiency counters

- Included tools / accepted optional child Issues:
- Scope-freeze to clean-main elapsed time:
- Review rounds:
- Candidate builds:
- Full CI runs:
- T4 / T5 / T6 runs:
- First candidate hardware pass:
- Environment / permission interruptions:
