# Vex Renderer Guidance

Use `vex renderers doctor` to check local renderer availability before long generated-visual jobs.

Install the shared version-locked HyperFrames and Remotion runtime with either
first-class command:

```bash
vex renderers install hyperframes
vex renderers install remotion
```

The installer requires Node.js 22+ and npm, executes the packaged `npm ci`
lockfile for the selected OS and CPU, verifies the installed HyperFrames
version, and atomically promotes the runtime into Vex's user data directory.
Runtime directories are isolated by platform, architecture, libc, Node major,
and Node module ABI. The installer verifies the exact Remotion, Remotion
renderer/bundler, React, React DOM, and HyperFrames package versions, then loads
Sharp, Rspack, and the platform-specific Remotion compositor before promotion.
It never trusts a global
`hyperframes` executable or arbitrary current-directory `node_modules`.

Remotion uses the source checkout's Node runtime and exact package lock:

```bash
npm ci
vex renderers doctor
```

Remotion's native compositor currently supports Windows x64, Linux, and macOS.
On Windows ARM, use x64 Node under emulation or WSL/Linux. A private x64 Node
installation can be selected without replacing system Node:

```dotenv
VEX_NODE_PATH=C:\path\to\node.exe
VEX_NPM_PATH=C:\path\to\npm.cmd
```

Run `vex renderers install remotion` after changing Node architecture. The
installer selects an independent runtime automatically; `--force` is only
needed to rebuild the same identity. `vex renderers doctor` reports the selected
executable, architecture, runtime identity, and native dependency health before
a render starts.

`renderer=remotion` renders a job-scoped React composition through Remotion's
local SSR path. Preview/repair renders are H.264 MP4; final opaque assets are
ProRes HQ MOV and transparent overlays are ProRes 4444 MOV. Vex verifies the
codec, pixel format, alpha state, and BT.709 metadata before handing the asset
to the existing timeline compositor. Remotion does not take ownership of
timeline edits, undo, or final FFmpeg composition.

## Renderer Fit

HyperFrames is the default fit for evidence-backed explainers: UI/process diagrams, timelines, measured changes, causal relationships, decisions, architecture flows, and custom HTML-like motion.

Remotion is best for signed programmatic explainers: data graphics, routed
mechanisms, kinetic typography, spatial systems, source-grounded media, UI
callouts, timelines, and comparisons. It is a strict renderer choice via
`renderer=remotion`; flexible `renderer=auto` can include it in renderer
tournaments.

Automatic HyperFrames work does not select a decorative template directly. Vex first
builds `VisualExplanationIR`, signs a visual claim graph, reviews a semantic
storyboard, ranks curated role-constrained blueprints, and builds a structural
proof-program tournament. Unsupported ideas are rejected before HTML generation.

Manim is best for formulas, geometry, graphs, and math animations where symbolic layout matters.

Blender is best for 3D titles, product/model spins, logo reveals, and spatial overlays.

FFmpeg asset insertion is best for local MP4/WebM/GIF/image inserts and practical video scaling/export.

## HyperFrames Quality Architecture

- 23 curated semantic blueprints cover 11 explanation scene types and act as search priors.
- Five structural encoding families generate distinct explanatory programs.
- Required labels, objects, directed relations, motion, screenshot tests, forbidden content, and signatures travel with every render.
- Interface scenes prefer a real source-video frame when the source is a screen recording or slide.
- Four sampled times are checked for required objects, meaningful motion, and a readable resolved hold.
- Blind inverse decoding receives no intended answer and must recover the thesis, objects, relations, and sequence.
- Relation-ablation and temporal-scramble counterfactuals test whether the authored grammar is necessary.
- A bounded repair pass may fix grounded copy placement, object coverage, semantic motion, or final hold only after untouched candidates compete.
- Failed variants are never promoted as the least-bad result.
- Legacy templates remain available for compatibility, but automatic generation compiles to `semantic_*` stage families.

## Native Generated-Video Architecture

`vex generate-video` uses HyperFrames as a native motion-production runtime, not
just an HTML slide renderer. After script, audio, transcript, beat graph, and
semantic cinematography planning, Vex writes:

This path is still very early-stage. It is useful for proof videos and focused
technical explainers, but it still lacks a lot of the range, taste, long-form
planning, and consistency expected from a mature general-purpose video generator.
Expect to iterate on prompts, scripts, and outputs.

- `MOTION_PLAN.json` with per-beat technique, camera, transition, caption, and
  capability choices.
- `motion_cues.json` with deterministic word/audio cue envelopes.
- template-backed `compositions/*.html` beat documents that keep registered
  HyperFrames timelines.
- a root `index.html` with render-visible inline native beat surfaces,
  traceable `data-external-composition-src` artifact links, transitions,
  captions, audio, cue variables, and beat-local motion metadata.

For showcase renders, prefer `vex generate-video ... --quality high --fps 60
--render-resolution 4k` when runtime cost is acceptable.

## Examples

- `Use HyperFrames from 01:12 to 01:18 with a dark blue background, yellow title, three animated cards.`
- `Use Manim to animate this equation at 00:45.`
- `Add auto visuals using Remotion for the UI and timeline scenes.`
- `Use Blender to add a rotating 3D title from 00:10 to 00:14.`
- `add_visual_asset --start 12.5 --end 18 --asset path/to/visual.html --mode replace`
- `add_visual_asset --start 12 --end 16 --asset overlay.mp4 --mode overlay`
- `upscale_video --resolution 1920x1080`

## Scaling

`scale to 1080p` means FFmpeg resize/export with Lanczos filtering. This pass does not include AI super-resolution.

Scale modes:

- `fit`: preserve aspect ratio and pad if needed.
- `fill`: preserve aspect ratio and crop to fill the frame.
- `stretch`: resize exactly and distort if the aspect ratio differs.

## Skill Pack

The repository includes `skills/vex-hyperframes-director`. It defines mandatory
grounding rules, scene-family selection, deterministic motion guidance, QA order,
bounded repair, rerouting, and regression requirements. Runtime skill retrieval
also injects scene-specific guidance into composition metadata.
