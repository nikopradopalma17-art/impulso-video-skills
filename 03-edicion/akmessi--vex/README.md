Vex is a source-available, non-commercial AI video editing agent for the terminal. Launch `vex`, talk to it in plain English, point it at a video file, and it edits a safe working copy of your footage using FFmpeg, MoviePy, transcript intelligence, generated visuals, and an LLM-driven tool loop.

It is built for creators and builders who want CLI speed without memorizing editing commands, FFmpeg flags, subtitle workflows, color-correction knobs, or export presets.

## Highlights

| You ask for | Vex handles |
|---|---|
| "Trim the awkward intro and remove pauses." | Timestamp parsing, silence detection, timeline-safe edits, and rebuildable project state |
| "Auto color grade this properly." | Shot-aware exposure, contrast, saturation, white balance, look selection, preview scoring, and output validation |
| "Add subtitle-aware zoom effects." | Caption timing, emphasis scoring, punch-ins, pans, pulses, freeze accents, vignette, flash, focus, and subtitle highlights in one replayable pass |
| "Add visuals where the explanation needs them." | Transcript beat mining, renderer selection, Hyperframes, Manim, or Remotion generation, QA, and compositing |
| "Turn this podcast into shorts." | Shorts Director planning, highlight selection, vertical reframing, captions, hooks, scoring, metadata, and bundle manifests |
| "Convert this MOV to MP4 and compress it." | Metadata inspection, encode planning, safe FFmpeg command generation, confirmation, and validation |

## Why Vex

- Natural language first: describe the edit you want instead of memorizing tool syntax
- Safe by design: original footage stays untouched while Vex edits a project working copy
- Stateful projects: resume later with timeline history, undo, redo, and rebuild support intact
- Real editing operations: trims, overlays, audio edits, subtitle burn-in, silence cleanup, exports, and more
- Production-minded auto color grading: sampled-frame analysis builds reusable FFmpeg grades with shot-aware candidate scoring and validation
- Subtitle-aware auto effects: caption beats can trigger punch-ins, punch-outs, slow pushes, pans, pulses, freeze accents, subtle shake, vignette, flash, focus, and subtitle-safe highlights
- Transcript-aware visuals: Vex can plan explanatory inserts from narration, generate them with Hyperframes, Manim, Remotion, or typed Blender 3D asset templates, and composite them back into the cut
- Plain-English encoding: messy export requests become inspected, validated FFmpeg plans before anything runs
- Multi-provider ready: Gemini by default, Claude or local OpenAI-compatible providers when configured
- Live run status: see the active tool, progress, and optional trace artifacts while the agent works
- Terminal-native: fast, scriptable, and easy to integrate into existing workflows

## What Vex Can Do

### Core editing

- Inspect video metadata
- Trim clips by timestamp
- Merge multiple clips
- Adjust playback speed for a full clip or a selected segment
- Add fade in, fade out, and fade-through-black transitions
- Add timed text overlays
- Remove silent gaps from raw footage
- Extract selected highlight segments into a shorter cut
- Auto color grade with natural, vibrant, cinematic, warm, cool, documentary, or punchy looks

### Audio

- Extract audio as `mp3`, `wav`, or `aac`
- Replace a video's audio track
- Mix external audio with original audio
- Mute a selected time range

### Captions and transcript workflows

- Transcribe video locally with Whisper
- Generate `transcript.txt` and `transcript.srt`
- Burn subtitles directly into the video from an SRT file
- Auto-summarize long clips into highlight cuts using transcript-aware segment selection
- Auto-create multiple vertical shorts with a typed Shorts Director v3 program, graph-searched multi-source edit plans, captions, ranking, hooks, metadata, and a bundle manifest
- Score candidate clips with a shared local Video Understanding Graph for retention, visual opportunity, topic alignment, hook strength, payoff, novelty, clarity, shareability, standalone story completeness, pacing, and topic diversity before final selection
- Run pre-render edit-plan validation plus final transcript quality gates so abrupt, incoherent, invalid, or weak-payoff cuts are rejected before the final manifest
- Generate timestamped B-roll suggestions for each short
- Fetch and splice subtitle-aligned, transcript-aware stock B-roll from configured providers such as Pexels, Pixabay, and Coverr into the working video
- Add context-aware auto emphasis effects from full-video rhythm, transcript timing, scene stability, pacing, pauses, questions, numeric claims, contrast turns, and payoff lines
- Generate transcript-aligned custom visuals and animations with Hyperframes-first HTML motion slides, typed Blender 3D assets, and Manim retained for specialist math/geometry scenes
- Generate brand-new audio-synced HyperFrames videos from a prompt or script without loading a source video
- Add transcript-driven punch-in moments for emphasis inside generated shorts
- Record local creative-run history with graph versions, quality scores, manifest paths, and output artifacts for shorts, visuals, and color grading
- Optimize Auto Visuals as a coherent semantic portfolio, compare compatible renderers by measured output quality, learn bounded project-local quality priors, and verify the final encoded composite before changing project state
- Author Auto Visuals as signed, evidence-bound Open Visual Programs so the model
  can control primitives, layout, metaphor, and choreography without receiving
  unrestricted renderer-code execution

## Local Creative Intelligence

Vex now builds a shared local `VideoUnderstandingGraph` for the highest-level creative automation paths. Auto shorts, auto visuals, and auto color grading no longer depend only on isolated feature heuristics; they share local evidence about transcript beats, retention moments, topic weights, scene cuts, quality contracts, and graph-backed scoring.

Each successful creative run records:

- a feature manifest with the creative graph or graph summary
- a creative QA report with score, pass/review status, issues, warnings, metrics, and evidence
- a local `creative_runs.json` registry entry in the project working directory
- dashboard and CLI visibility through `/creative-runs` or `vex creative-runs --project <project-id>`

## What's New: Auto Visuals

`add_auto_visuals` is the biggest recent addition to Vex.

Instead of only fetching stock footage, Vex can now:

- transcribe a talking-head or explainer video
- segment long transcripts into semantic episodes before scoring which spoken
  windows deserve a custom visual
- preflight source-grounded opportunity contracts through the HyperFrames
  semantic compiler before expensive scene authoring
- schedule a globally coherent visual set with episode-aware reserves instead
  of independently selecting the highest-scoring subtitle lines
- build a video-level visual narrative program with chapters, concept memory, continuity groups, and transition intent
- plan where a full-screen replacement is safe versus where picture-in-picture is smarter
- compile transcript evidence into typed facts, explanation objects, semantic beats, and explicit rejection reasons
- compile Remotion opportunities into signed semantic scene programs with
  hard evidence constraints, signed SceneGraph v2 capability plans, responsive
  constraint solving, measured text, and frame-driven motion before starting
  Chromium
- compile both HyperFrames and Remotion through one signed creative-direction
  harness for semantic medium choice, focal hierarchy, art direction,
  choreography, negative space, and video-level anti-repetition
- author multiple complete Open Visual Program scene graphs, reject invented or
  unbound content, and preserve deterministic candidates when model authoring is
  unavailable
- compile narration into signed atomic propositions and viewer questions, then
  search six distinct visual concept lanes with four-frame reference boards
- inspect final rendered frames with a blind multimodal verifier, retry through
  independent providers, and keep unavailable, degraded, verified, and rejected
  states explicit
- render a bounded alternate concept and use order-reversed pairwise judging to
  choose the clearer and more beautiful silent explanation
- apply typed counterexample-guided repairs, re-render them, and accept only
  candidates that improve without semantic or technical regression
- evaluate the complete published set for repeated concept lanes, media, motion
  grammar, composition, palette, and rendered appearance
- select a role-constrained semantic blueprint and sign a production contract before Hyperframes receives a render spec
- generate transcript-aligned custom visuals with a deterministic Hyperframes HTML renderer
- compile every Hyperframes scene through a typed design IR for art direction, density, theme, safe areas, and motion intensity
- carry episode context, visual beats, recurring concepts, and transition contracts into Hyperframes metadata
- ground interface walkthroughs in real captured source frames when the source contains a screen or slide
- render multiple art-directed variants, inspect semantic state at four times, score extracted frames for contrast, occupancy, dead space, edge safety, and motion, then promote only a passing version
- score rendered candidates with a shared aesthetic critic for balance,
  hierarchy, depth, palette vitality, edge safety, whitespace, and settled
  motion before promotion
- lint, validate, and render those scenes before the final composite
- optimize the complete visual set for quality, semantic coverage, diversity, and clean timing instead of truncating candidates by timestamp
- substitute a preflighted reserve when a primary scene fails compilation,
  rendering, or final timeline QA
- remember failed source moments inside the project so retries do not repeat
  the same rejected visual concept
- compare compatible renderer outputs through a bounded quality tournament when renderer routing is flexible
- verify the final encoded replacement frames, duration, resolution, file integrity, and audio before project-state promotion
- learn conservative project-local renderer and intent priors from repeated render QA outcomes without bypassing hard gates
- fall back to specialist renderers only when a scene needs a different engine
- render deterministic Blender 3D assets from typed specs for titles, labels, pointers, product spins, object orbits, logo reveals, and data tunnels without allowing raw Blender Python from the agent

The current renderer stack is:

- `hyperframes` for premium HTML/CSS motion slides, process diagrams, product UI scenes, comparisons, timelines, data-driven explainers, causal chains, flywheels, decision matrices, anatomy cutaways, rankings, contrast ladders, proof sequences, and narrative arcs with built-in variant QA
- `remotion` for source-grounded React motion graphics compiled into typed
  metric, mechanism, contrast, timeline, interface, and emphasis programs. It
  renders and scores six distinct treatments in one browser session, gates
  solved geometry and dense temporal samples, and emits verified ProRes masters
  through Remotion's local SSR APIs
- `manim` for formula-heavy math, geometry, axes, and visuals that genuinely need Manim's object model
- `ffmpeg` for fast editorial overlays and clean picture-in-picture support graphics
- `blender` for optional deterministic 3D assets when Blender is installed. Vex owns timing, project state, undo/rebuild, and final FFmpeg compositing; Blender only renders the visual asset.

Best results today:

- short and long-form explainers, tutorials, essays, and talking-head videos
- beats with clear process, contrast, numbers, or "how it works" structure
- multi-sentence windows with enough local evidence and screen time for a
  custom visual to actually add intuition

Vex deliberately tries to skip weak beats instead of forcing generic filler.

## Auto Color Grading

`auto_color_grade` analyzes sampled frames from the current working cut, builds a deterministic Color Grade Director plan, and applies a reusable FFmpeg filter graph. The timeline stores the exact filter graph, so undo, redo, and project rebuilds do not depend on re-running analysis.

It corrects:

- exposure and gamma drift
- low contrast or overly harsh contrast
- muted saturation
- red, green, or blue color casts through bounded white balance
- weak black/white points with guarded level normalization
- flat footage with subtle look-aware contrast curves
- screen recordings, talking heads, product shots, low-light shots, and already-graded footage with subject-aware protection budgets

The analyzer weights reliable frames, skips flat transition frames, estimates white balance from neutral midtones instead of saturated image regions, and guards saturation/channel changes when skin-tone-like pixels are present. The Color Grade Director classifies each shot, picks an auto-look policy, caps risky saturation/contrast/gamma changes for UI and skin, scores multiple preview candidates, and smooths similar neighboring shots so the grade does not flicker between scenes.

After rendering, Vex samples the graded output again and records a validation score with warnings for remaining clipping, low contrast, extreme brightness, or risky saturation. The color-grade tool also attaches a local creative QA report that combines output validation, shot validation, director metadata, candidate scoring, preview coverage, correction strength, and warnings into one publishability signal.

Supported looks are `auto`, `natural`, `vibrant`, `cinematic`, `warm`, `cool`, `documentary`, and `punchy`.

### Export and delivery

- Export with built-in presets for YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, X, and podcast audio
- Plan plain-English FFmpeg encode, conversion, compression, and target-size commands before running them
- Validate encoded files with `ffprobe` plus a full FFmpeg decode pass before reporting success
- Export directly from the REPL or from the CLI
- Estimate output size and check disk space before export

### Project system

- Persistent saved projects
- Auto-load a project when you mention a known video path
- Deterministic project loading
- Undo and redo through timeline rebuild
- Timeline inspection and project summaries

## The Intended Experience

This is the default workflow:

```text
> vex

[Vex banner]
Vex > trim the first 30 seconds of "D:\videos\clip.mp4"
Vex > remove awkward pauses
Vex > burn subtitles
Vex > export it for instagram
Vex > /quit
```

You do not need to type subcommands inside the session.

If no project is loaded, include a video path in your first message and Vex handles the rest.

During each turn, Vex shows a live status spinner with the active tool name. If you want the deeper activity log afterward, use `/trace`.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- FFmpeg installed and available on `PATH`
- `yt-dlp` available through the Python environment for YouTube downloads
- `openai-whisper` is optional and only needed for local transcription
- Node.js 22+ and npm are required for HyperFrames- or Remotion-powered generated visuals
- `manim` is optional for specialist math, geometry, and axes-heavy generated visuals
- `blender` is optional if you want typed 3D titles, transparent overlays, product/model spins, logo reveals, object orbits, and cinematic replacement shots; set `BLENDER_PATH` to `blender`, a full executable path, or a Blender install directory if it is not already on `PATH`

FFmpeg install:

- macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
- Windows: install from `https://ffmpeg.org/download.html` and add `ffmpeg/bin` to `PATH`

### Install Vex

`pipx` is the recommended installation method because it gives Vex an isolated
Python environment while keeping the `vex` command available globally:

```bash
pipx install vex-video
```

Standard `pip` installation is also supported:

```bash
python -m pip install vex-video
```

Optional feature sets:

```bash
pipx install "vex-video[transcription]"
pipx install "vex-video[manim]"
pipx install "vex-video[all]"
```

For an existing pipx installation, install Whisper into Vex's isolated
environment with:

```bash
vex setup transcription
```

Vex also discovers a `python` or `python3` executable on `PATH` that already
contains Whisper. Set `WHISPER_PYTHON_PATH` when the intended interpreter is
not the first one on `PATH`.

For a source checkout used for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AKMessi/vex.git
cd vex
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
vex --version
vex renderers doctor
```

For HyperFrames or Remotion visuals, install Vex's shared version-locked renderer runtime explicitly:

```bash
vex renderers install hyperframes
vex renderers install remotion
```

This runs `npm ci` from the lockfile shipped with the installed Vex version. Vex
does not silently install Node packages during `pip install` or first launch.
For a source checkout, Remotion uses the repository `package-lock.json`; run
`npm ci` before `renderer=remotion` jobs.

See [docs/installing.md](docs/installing.md) for upgrades, release candidates,
rollbacks, optional features, and uninstall behavior.

### Windows PATH note

Run `pipx ensurepath`, restart the terminal, and retry. For a standard `pip`
installation, add your Python Scripts directory to `PATH`.

Example:

```text
C:\Users\aarya\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python314\Scripts
```

Your path may differ depending on your Python installation.

## Configuration

Create a local configuration template without needing a source checkout:

```bash
vex setup config
```

Vex refuses to overwrite an existing `.env` unless `--force` is supplied.
Then configure your provider in that file.

### Default provider

Vex defaults to Gemini.

```env
PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemma-4-31b-it
```

### Claude support

If you want Claude instead:

```env
PROVIDER=claude
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Local LLM support

Vex can also use local OpenAI-compatible servers such as Ollama, LM Studio, and llama.cpp:

```env
PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:14b
```

See [docs/local-llms.md](docs/local-llms.md) for the full setup guide and troubleshooting notes.

## Quick Start

### First run

```bash
vex
```

Then type a normal sentence with a video path:

```text
Vex > trim the first 30 seconds of "D:\videos\clip.mp4"
```

Then continue naturally:

```text
Vex > remove the silent pauses
Vex > add "DealScout" at the bottom for the first 4 seconds
Vex > export it for youtube
Vex > /quit
```

### If a project already exists

- If exactly one saved project exists, Vex resumes it automatically
- If multiple saved projects exist, Vex starts clean and waits for a file path or an explicit project command
- If you mention a video path that already belongs to a saved project, Vex reuses that project instead of creating a duplicate

## Vex Studio

Vex also ships with a local web app for the same project and agent architecture:

```bash
vex web
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) in a browser. To open it automatically, use:

```bash
vex web --open
```

Studio v1 provides local video upload or local-path project creation, a working-cut preview backed by the project file on disk, plain-English editing through the existing intent compiler and agent loop, live plan/tool trace updates, project metadata, timeline history, creative runs, and a project library.

The Studio server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and does not add a cloud service or database. Because the API can open local media paths, Vex deliberately rejects non-loopback interfaces. Use `--host` only to select another loopback address such as `localhost` or `::1`, and use `--port` to choose a different local port.

Uploads are streamed into a private temporary file and then copied into the project workspace; the browser never needs to hold the complete video in memory. Studio also resumes active task progress after a refresh and rejects cross-site API writes.

## Natural-Language Examples

### Basic trim

```text
Vex > trim the first 15 seconds of "D:\videos\intro.mp4"
```

### Speed up a section

```text
Vex > speed up the section from 1:10 to 1:35 by 1.25x
```

### Remove pauses

```text
Vex > remove the silent gaps
```

### Add subtitles

```text
Vex > transcribe this video
Vex > burn subtitles in yellow at the bottom
Vex > add cinematic subtitles
Vex > add creator bold captions for shorts
```

### Add a song or soundtrack

```text
Vex > add background music assets/beat.mp3
Vex > add song assets/intro.wav as intro and outro music
Vex > add assets/theme.mp3 from 00:12 to 00:28 at 20% volume
Vex > replace the soundtrack with assets/final-track.m4a
```

`add_song` uses Music Director v1 instead of a raw fixed-ratio audio mix. It
classifies the request into a song-mix skill, trims or loops the song to the
video or selected segment, adds fades, ducks music under existing speech when
needed, normalizes loudness, renders a deterministic FFmpeg filter graph, and
promotes the result only after audio QA passes. Each run writes a
`song_mix_bundles/.../manifest.json`, `mix_plan.json`, `filtergraph.txt`,
`audio_qa.json`, and notes file so the mix can be audited and replayed.

### Summarize a long video

```text
Vex > make this a 60 second highlight reel
```

### Create viral-style shorts

```text
Vex > turn this podcast into 4 YouTube Shorts with captions
```

Auto shorts can build either one continuous clip or a stitched edit plan from multiple source ranges. Vex keeps the timeline and FFmpeg render path in control; the Shorts Director chooses typed source ranges, hard cuts, punch-ins, caption emphasis, and contextual visual insert intent, then validates the plan before rendering.

### Create shorts from a YouTube link

```text
Vex > make 3 shorts from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example123
```

### Add stock B-roll automatically

```text
Vex > add auto b-roll from Pexels to this video
Vex > add auto b-roll using Pixabay and Coverr
Vex > add 4 stock cutaways that match the narration
```

`add_auto_broll` uses B-roll Director v2. It builds a video-level context graph, turns transcript beats into typed visual intents, searches all configured stock providers by default, verifies candidate visual fit, and runs a final abruptness/semantic QA gate before rendering. Set one or more of `PEXELS_API_KEY`, `PIXABAY_API_KEY`, and `COVERR_API_KEY`, then optionally control provider order with `AUTO_BROLL_PROVIDERS=auto` or a comma-separated list such as `pexels,pixabay`. Vex normalizes candidates from each provider, reranks them against the active subtitle and nearby transcript context, caches the chosen clip locally, and writes `stock_attribution.md` in the run bundle.

### Add generated visuals automatically

```text
Vex > add precise generated visuals wherever the explanation needs them
Vex > create custom animations for the key claims and process steps in this video
Vex > use clean product-style generated visuals for the UI explanations
```

`add_auto_visuals` now uses a transcript-aware planner, a video-level visual narrative program, context-aware visual budgeting, source-frame visual-need scoring, renderer auto-selection, and a signed Open Visual Program authoring tournament shared by HyperFrames and Remotion. Templates remain deterministic fallbacks instead of limiting automatic composition. If the transcript has many high-signal visual opportunities, Vex can plan a denser sequence instead of stopping after one or two inserts. Today it can choose between:

- `hyperframes` for premium HTML/CSS motion slides, diagrams, flows, comparisons, UI explainers, causal chains, flywheels, decision matrices, anatomy cutaways, rankings, proof sequences, narrative arcs, concept maps, problem/solution pivots, myth-busters, checklists, radar scans, opportunity maps, scorecards, pipeline X-rays, decision trees, momentum waves, focus rings, filmstrip timelines, quote breakdowns, market maps, mechanism blueprints, data pulses, and data-heavy visual inserts
- `remotion` for signed SceneGraph v2 visual programs, specialized SVG/DOM
  primitives, rendered six-treatment search, frame-driven data explanations,
  spatial metaphors, UI callouts, timelines, comparisons, and process
  explainers. Final inserts use ProRes HQ; transparent overlays use ProRes 4444.
- `manim` for formula-heavy math, geometry, axes, and specialist vector animation
- `ffmpeg` for fast, clean editorial cards and picture-in-picture support graphics
- `blender` for deterministic 3D titles, transparent overlays, object/model shots, logo reveals, product spins, and cinematic data/abstract inserts when Blender is installed

Suggested prompts:

```text
Vex > add auto visuals
Vex > add auto visuals with hyperframes
Vex > add auto visuals with manim
Vex > add auto visuals with remotion
Vex > add auto visuals with both hyperframes and manim
Vex > add custom animations only where they make the explanation clearer
Vex > use generated visuals for the process beats and keep everything else clean
Vex > add a rotating 3D title saying Matrix Multiplication at 00:18
Vex > add a floating 3D arrow pointing to the chart on the right from 00:12 to 00:16
Vex > add a cinematic glowing chip animation when I say GPU
Vex > add a 3D product spin overlay using assets/model.glb from 5s to 9s
```

Blender 3D support is opt-in and typed. The agent can choose a template and parameters, but Vex compiles those parameters into internal deterministic Blender Python. It never asks the LLM to emit raw Blender scripts.

Supported Blender templates:

- `three_d_title`
- `floating_3d_label`
- `object_orbit`
- `logo_reveal`
- `screen_pointer_3d`
- `data_tunnel`
- `product_model_spin`
- legacy Blender templates: `quote_focus`, `keyword_stack`, `metric_callout`

Composition modes:

- `replace` renders a normal full-screen MP4 insert that Vex cuts into the timeline.
- `overlay` renders transparent Blender frames, encodes an alpha-capable asset, and lets Vex composite it with FFmpeg over the source video.

Supported local 3D model formats are `.glb`, `.gltf`, `.obj`, and `.blend`. Asset paths must stay inside the project or workspace-safe input roots. Blender remains optional; if it is unavailable, non-3D auto visuals continue to use Hyperframes, Remotion, Manim, or FFmpeg as appropriate.

Hyperframes tuning:

- Plain `add auto visuals` in the agent asks you to choose `hyperframes`, `manim`, `remotion`, or `both` before rendering.
- `renderer=hyperframes` is strict Hyperframes-only and will not fall back to Manim.
- `renderer=manim` is strict Manim-only and will not fall back to Hyperframes.
- `renderer=remotion` is strict Remotion-only and will not fall back to Hyperframes or Manim.
- `renderer=both` lets Vex choose between Hyperframes and Manim per visual.
- Auto Visuals Director v3 samples tiny source frames, scores whether the moment actually needs a generated insert, rejects weak semantic matches, and drops rendered Hyperframes/Remotion/Manim outputs that fail renderer QA before compositing.
- Auto Visuals uses deterministic set optimization before and after rendering, so stronger and more diverse candidates can replace weaker or overlapping candidates.
- Flexible `auto` and `both` runs use bounded renderer quality tournaments; strict renderer requests remain strict.
- Auto Visuals and Auto B-roll run shared encoded-composite QA before state mutation.
- `AUTO_VISUALS_RENDERER_TOURNAMENT_SIZE` controls successful contenders per flexible visual, default `2`, capped at `3`.
- `VISUAL_COMPOSITE_SIMILARITY_FLOOR` controls replacement-frame publish similarity, default `0.72`.
- Full-screen generated replacements receive soft transition handles automatically so the compositor avoids abrupt slide cuts when the plan did not specify transitions.
- `HYPERFRAMES_PROOF_CANDIDATE_COUNT` controls how many structurally distinct proof programs Auto Visuals renders, capped at 8
- `HYPERFRAMES_VARIANT_COUNT` remains the legacy/manual art-direction variant control
- `HYPERFRAMES_MIN_QUALITY_SCORE` sets the promotion threshold used by extracted-frame QA
- `HYPERFRAMES_QA_MODE` records whether the run should be treated as `local`, `hybrid`, or `vision` QA
- `HYPERFRAMES_ENABLE_COUNTERFACTUAL_QA` tests whether relation geometry and time order are necessary for comprehension
- `HYPERFRAMES_BLIND_DECODER_MIN_SCORE` sets the blind semantic recovery threshold
- `HYPERFRAMES_RENDER_QUALITY` can be set to `draft`, `standard`, `high`, or left empty for the Hyperframes default
- `HYPERFRAMES_RENDER_TIMEOUT_SEC` defaults to `0`, which disables the Hyperframes render timeout
- `REMOTION_RENDER_TIMEOUT_SEC` defaults to `0`, which lets Vex use Remotion's internal timeout while disabling the outer process timeout
- `REMOTION_RENDER_CONCURRENCY` optionally forwards a Remotion render concurrency value such as `1`, `2`, or `50%`
- `OPEN_VISUAL_PROGRAM_LLM_AUTHORING` enables evidence-bound model scene-graph authoring; invalid output automatically falls back to the deterministic compiler
- `OPEN_VISUAL_PROGRAM_CANDIDATES` controls the shared concept tournament size, default `6`, capped at `6`
- `OPEN_VISUAL_PROGRAM_AUTHORING_ATTEMPTS` controls the initial authoring call plus one validation-aware retry, capped at `2`
- `OPEN_VISUAL_PROGRAM_MIN_SCORE` sets the pre-render grounding, motion, novelty, and semantic-fitness acceptance floor
- `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_ENABLED` enables the final-render Visual Director boundary for HyperFrames and Remotion
- `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_VERIFICATION_MODE` is `strict`, `balanced`, or `off`; balanced outages can publish only an explicitly degraded candidate above the local floor
- `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_VISION_MODEL` and `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_CLAUDE_VISION_MODEL` select independent Gemini and Claude vision models
- `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_RENDER_CANDIDATES` controls bounded full-render concept search, default `2`, capped at `3`

- `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_MIN_REPAIR_DELTA` sets the minimum monotonic score improvement, default `0.025`
- `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_PAIRWISE_TOP_K` controls the blind pairwise finalist count, default `3`, capped at `4`
- `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_VERIFIER_RETRIES`, `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_CIRCUIT_FAILURES`, and `VISUAL_DIRECTOR_CIRCUIT_COOLDOWN_SEC` bound provider reliability behavior

### Add subtitle-aware effects automatically

```text
Vex > add subtitle-aware auto effects
Vex > add strong zoom effects where the captions need emphasis
Vex > add subtle camera-only effects, no style accents
```

`add_auto_effects` treats subtitle/caption timing as the source of truth. It scores each subtitle beat for hooks, questions, numbers, contrast turns, payoff language, pauses, and nearby scene cuts, then sends the selected beats through Auto Effects Director. The director chooses a taste profile, converts effects into a bounded camera-motion plan, softens unsafe zooms/shakes/flashes, validates the motion path, renders one deterministic FFmpeg pass, and samples tiny rendered preview frames before accepting the output. Effects include `punch_in`, `punch_out`, `slow_push`, `micro_pan`, `snap_reframe`, `impact_pulse`, `freeze_accent`, `subtle_shake`, `vignette`, `flash_accent`, `focus_blur`, and `subtitle_highlight`.

Taste profiles can be requested with `taste_profile` / `effect_taste_profile` when calling the tool, or `--taste-profile` in the CLI: `clean_documentary`, `viral_commentary`, `tutorial_focus`, `cinematic_subtle`, or `high_energy_shorts`. If omitted, Vex infers one from rhythm, density, intensity, duration, and aspect ratio.

### Export for social

```text
Vex > export it for instagram
```

### Auto color grade

```text
Vex > auto color grade this video
Vex > give it a subtle cinematic look
Vex > make the colors pop
```

## CLI Commands

Vex supports both a conversational mode and explicit power-user commands.

### `vex`

Start the interactive REPL.

### `vex web`

Start the loopback-only Vex Studio web app. The default address is `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

```bash
vex web --open
vex web --port 5174
```

### `vex shorts`

Generate a packaged shorts bundle directly from an existing project.

```bash
vex shorts --project <project-id> --count 4 --target-platform youtube_shorts
```

Add `--subtitle-style glass` or another subtitle preset to change the burned caption look for the generated shorts.

### `vex auto-broll`

Plan and apply provider-backed stock footage inserts to an existing project.

```bash
vex auto-broll --project <project-id> --max-overlays 5
vex auto-broll --project <project-id> --providers pixabay,coverr --max-overlays 5
vex auto-broll --project <project-id> --max-overlays 15 --coverage-policy target_count
```

### `vex auto-visuals`

Plan and apply generated supporting visuals to an existing project.

```bash
vex auto-visuals --project <project-id> --max-visuals 4 --renderer auto --style-pack editorial_clean
vex auto-visuals --project <project-id> --renderer hyperframes
vex auto-visuals --project <project-id> --renderer remotion
vex auto-visuals --project <project-id> --renderer both
vex auto-visuals --project <project-id> --max-visuals 18 --coverage-policy target_count --density chapter_coverage
```

Generic requests use `quality_only`. Explicit counts use `target_count`; `exact_count`
raises coverage pressure but still cannot bypass path, render, semantic, or QA failures.

### `vex generate-video`

Generate a new HyperFrames video without a source clip. Vex writes an audio-first native-motion project with a narration script, TTS audio, timed beat graph, director crew contract, video-generation skill graph, per-beat HyperFrames compositions, motion cues, transitions, captions, portfolio QA report, manifest, and final render.

The generator now uses a deterministic Video Generation Skill Graph before
cinematography. It classifies the whole video into a production skill, assigns
every beat a source-grounded visual skill, seeds HyperFrames semantic frames,
steers proof tournaments and native motion, writes `VIDEO_SKILL_GRAPH.json`, and
makes skill coverage part of portfolio and generated-video QA.

```bash
vex generate-video "explain retrieval augmented generation in 30 seconds" --duration 30
vex generate-video "show why KV cache compression matters" --aspect portrait --voice af_nova
vex generate-video "show sparse attention becoming a focused reasoning path" --quality high --fps 60 --render-resolution 4k
vex generate-video "turn this into a project only" --no-render --no-audio --output-dir D:\renders\vex-tests
```

The generated project is stored under `~/.video-agent/generated_videos` unless `--output-dir` is provided.
Generated videos use a Director Crew pass before rendering. The director repairs
weak prompt-only scripts, writes `DIRECTOR_CREW.json`, assigns each beat a
source-grounded visual contract, then the skill graph converts those contracts
into explicit beat skills, renderer routes, proof encodings, visual-world
priors, continuity subjects, and motion grammar. Compatible HyperFrames variants
enter a per-beat tournament. The native motion compiler writes
`MOTION_PLAN.json`, `motion_cues.json`, template-backed `compositions/*.html`,
root inline native beat surfaces with traceable `data-external-composition-src`
artifact links, and rendered-frame QA. A portfolio judge writes
`PORTFOLIO_JUDGE.json` and can reject the whole project when the result is too
generic, repetitive, weakly grounded, or below skill-coverage policy.

### `vex add_visual_asset`

Insert an exact-time local asset without transcript scoring:

```bash
vex add_visual_asset --project <project-id> --asset assets/overlay.mp4 --start 12 --end 16 --mode overlay
vex add_visual_asset --project <project-id> --asset assets/visual.html --start 72 --end 78 --mode replace
```

Local HTML cannot reference remote URLs or Node/shell execution hooks.

### `vex upscale_video`

```bash
vex upscale_video --project <project-id> --resolution 1920x1080 --scale-mode fit
```

This is FFmpeg Lanczos resize/export, not AI super-resolution.

### `vex renderers doctor`

```bash
vex renderers doctor
```

Install the shared managed HyperFrames and Remotion runtime:

```bash
vex renderers install hyperframes
vex renderers install remotion
```

### `vex auto-effects`

Plan and apply context-aware emphasis effects to an existing project. The planner reads the whole transcript timeline, local pacing, scene stability, blocked overlay ranges, and subtitle placement before selecting restrained camera/style moves.

```bash
vex auto-effects --project <project-id> --density medium --intensity high --max-effects 12
```

### `vex creative-runs`

Inspect recent local creative automation runs recorded for a project.

```bash
vex creative-runs --project <project-id>
```

### `vex color-grade`

Analyze and apply an automatic color grade to an existing project.

```bash
vex color-grade --project <project-id> --look cinematic --intensity 0.8
```

### `vex youtube-shorts`

Download a YouTube video and immediately run the auto shorts workflow.

```bash
vex youtube-shorts "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example123" --count 4
```

- resumes the only saved project automatically
- otherwise waits for natural-language input
- if no video is loaded, include a file path in your message

### `vex start <video_path> [--name TEXT]`

Create a new project explicitly and open the REPL.

```bash
vex start "D:\videos\clip.mp4" --name "Launch Cut"
```

### `vex repl [--project TEXT]`

Open the REPL for an existing project.

```bash
vex repl
vex repl --project 7e5a4d1c
```

### `vex run "<instruction>" --project TEXT`

Run a single instruction against a saved project and exit.

```bash
vex run "export it for instagram" --project 7e5a4d1c
```

### `vex projects`

List saved projects.

### `vex export <preset_name> --project TEXT [--output TEXT]`

Export without entering the REPL.

```bash
vex export instagram_reels --project 7e5a4d1c --output "D:\exports\clip.mp4"
```

### `vex encode "<request>" --project TEXT [--output TEXT] [--yes]`

Plan a metadata-aware FFmpeg encode from plain English. By default Vex prints the command and stores it as pending; pass `--yes` to run it immediately.

```bash
vex encode "convert this MOV to MP4 and compress it without losing much quality" --project 7e5a4d1c
```

After the FFmpeg command finishes, Vex probes the output, checks the expected container, streams, codecs, dimensions, duration, and target-size behavior, then runs a full decode smoke test. If validation finds a fatal issue, the encode is reported as failed instead of silently accepting a bad file.

### `vex --version`

Show the installed version.

## How Project Loading Works

- Vex never edits the original source file directly
- each project stores:
  - original source path
  - working copy path
  - timeline operations
  - provider and model
  - session log
  - metadata
- when you mention a video path in the REPL:
  - Vex checks for an existing project for that exact source file
  - if found, it loads that project
  - otherwise, it creates a new project automatically

Default project storage:

```text
~/.video-agent/projects/
```

You can override that with `AGENT_PROJECTS_DIR`.

## Dependencies and Runtime Notes

### FFmpeg is mandatory

Vex depends on FFmpeg for:

- metadata probing
- trims and merges
- audio processing
- subtitle burn-in
- silence detection
- exports

### Whisper is optional

`transcribe_video` requires `openai-whisper` and a local environment capable of running it. Install it with:

```bash
vex setup transcription
```

Installing Whisper into a separate system Python does not expose it to a Vex
installation managed by pipx directly. Vex bridges that boundary through a
bounded external worker when the interpreter is discoverable on `PATH` or
configured with `WHISPER_PYTHON_PATH`.

### Text overlays on Windows may require ImageMagick

MoviePy text rendering on Windows can require ImageMagick.

If timed text overlays fail, install it from:

```text
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows
```

### Subtitle burning depends on FFmpeg ASS subtitle support

Vex compiles SRT captions into styled ASS files, then burns them with FFmpeg's `ass` filter. Most full FFmpeg builds include libass support. If yours does not, subtitle burn-in may fail until you install a build with subtitle filter support.

## Troubleshooting

### `vex` is not recognized

Add your Python Scripts directory to `PATH`, then restart the terminal.

### `FFmpeg was not found in PATH`

Install FFmpeg and verify `ffmpeg` works in the terminal before launching Vex.

### Vex says no video is loaded

Start with a normal sentence that includes a file path:

```text
Vex > trim the first 10 seconds of "D:\videos\clip.mp4"
```

### Subtitle burn-in fails

Check that:

- your `transcript.srt` exists
- your FFmpeg build supports the `ass` filter / libass
- the subtitle path is valid on your OS

### Text overlay fails on Windows

Install ImageMagick and retry.

### Transcription fails

Run `vex setup transcription`. Vex will reuse a discoverable system Python
that already has Whisper, or install Whisper into its own environment when no
compatible external runtime exists. Set `WHISPER_PYTHON_PATH` to select a
specific interpreter.

### Summarization does not work

Make sure:

- the active provider API key is configured
- transcription completed successfully
- `transcript.txt` and `transcript.srt` exist in the project working directory
