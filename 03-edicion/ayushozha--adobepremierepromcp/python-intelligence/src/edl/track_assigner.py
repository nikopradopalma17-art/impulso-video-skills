"""Track assignment logic for EDL generation.

Maps script segments to the appropriate timeline tracks based on segment type,
and resolves conflicts when two segments want the same track at the same time.

Track layout convention (matching the TypeScript bridge expectations):

    V1 -- Primary video (dialogue, action, on-camera)
    V2 -- B-roll (supplementary footage that can overlap V1)
    V3 -- Titles / lower thirds (text overlays rendered as graphics)
    A1 -- Main audio (dialogue audio, on-camera sound)
    A2 -- Voiceover
    A3 -- Music
    A4 -- Sound effects
