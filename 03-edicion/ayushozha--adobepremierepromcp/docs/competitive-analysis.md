---

### 2.5 nepfaff/premiere-pro-mcp (2 stars)

**Overview:** Minimal server with only 3 tools. Unique approach: uses UXP instead of CEP. Exposes a single `execute-script` tool that lets the LLM generate arbitrary UXP JavaScript.

**Architecture:**
```
MCP Client -> Node.js MCP Server -> File-based IPC -> UXP Plugin -> Premiere Pro UXP API
```

**Unique features:**
- UXP-based (not CEP) -- forward-looking for future Adobe API direction

## 5. Features Competitors Have That We Are Missing

These are features found in competitor projects that our project does not currently implement:

### 5.1 High Priority (found in top competitor)

| Feature | Found In | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP Resources** | hetpatel, leancoderkavy | Expose `config://premiere-instructions` and `config://extendscript-reference` as MCP resources that give the LLM operating context | High |
| **MCP Prompts** | hetpatel | MCP prompt templates for common workflows | High |
| **clipPlan LLM Control** | hetpatel | Structured `clipPlan` argument in assembly tools for LLM-directed per-clip timing, transitions, motion, trims, effects, and color | High |
| **Live Tool Sweep / Verifier** | hetpatel | Automated script that exercises every tool against a real Premiere session, writes sweep results to JSON | High |
| **Frame Capture (base64)** | leancoderkavy, antipaster | Export a frame from the timeline and return it as a base64-encoded image to the MCP client | High |

### 5.2 Medium Priority (useful differentiators)

| Feature | Found In | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **npm Distribution** | leancoderkavy | `npm install -g premiere-pro-mcp` for easy install | Medium |
| **Remote Deployment (Fly.io/SSE)** | leancoderkavy | HTTP/SSE transport for cloud-hosted MCP server with bearer token auth | Medium |
| **ElevenLabs TTS Integration** | antipaster | AI voiceover: list voices, generate speech, generate captions with voice | Medium |
| **TikTok Caption Generator** | antipaster | Pre-styled captions for TikTok/Reels/Shorts format | Medium |
| **WebSocket Bridge** | antipaster, bis-code | Lower-latency communication vs file polling | Medium |
| **Arbitrary ExtendScript Execution** | leancoderkavy, antipaster, nepfaff | `execute_extendscript` / `execute_qe_script` / `send_raw_script` tools | Medium |
| **Script Security Validation** | leancoderkavy | Block eval(), new Function(), System.callSystem() in scripts | Medium |
| **Source Monitor Control** | leancoderkavy, antipaster | Open clips in source monitor, insert/overwrite from source, 3-point editing | Medium |
| **DOM Object Inspector** | leancoderkavy | Interactive exploration of any Premiere Pro DOM object | Medium |

### 5.3 Low Priority (niche or future)

| Feature | Found In | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UXP Plugin Support** | nepfaff | UXP-based bridge using modern Premiere Pro UXP API (vs CEP) | Low (future) |
| **Auto-reframe for Social** | leancoderkavy, antipaster | `auto_reframe_sequence` for vertical/square/social crops | Low |
| **Scene Edit Detection** | antipaster | Built-in scene detection tool | Low |
| **Setup Doctor Script** | hetpatel | `npm run setup:doctor` validates the full install chain | Low |
| **Glama.ai Badge** | hetpatel | Listed on glama.ai MCP registry | Low |

## 6. Key Takeaways

1. **We have the most tools by far** (1,057 vs 269 next closest), but tool count alone does not win. hetpatel has 77 stars with only 97 tools because they focus on documentation, ease of install, and a few polished high-level workflows.

2. **MCP Resources and Prompts are table stakes** that two top competitors already implement. We should add these -- they help the LLM make better decisions without counting against tool calls.

3. **Frame capture as base64** is a powerful feature that two competitors have. It lets the LLM "see" what is on the timeline, enabling visual feedback loops.

4. **ElevenLabs TTS and TikTok captions** are niche but signal that competitors are building toward social-media-first workflows. Worth considering.

5. **No competitor touches our AI/NLP pipeline or Rust media engine.** Our script-to-edit and auto-edit capabilities are entirely unique.

6. **UXP is Adobe's future direction.** Only nepfaff has a UXP plugin. Our CEP approach works for 2020-2026, but long-term we should consider UXP support.

7. **Remote deployment (Fly.io)** is unique to leancoderkavy and enables cloud-hosted MCP. This is interesting for team workflows.

8. **hetpatel's main moat is community and polish**, not technical depth. They have 77 stars because of good docs, easy install, and a glama.ai listing.

## 7. Recommended Actions

### Immediate (to close competitive gaps)
1. Add MCP Resources (`config://premiere-instructions`, `config://extendscript-reference`)
2. Add MCP Prompts for common workflows
3. Add `premiere_capture_frame` tool that returns a base64 image
4. Add `premiere_execute_script` tool for arbitrary ExtendScript execution
5. Add a live tool sweep / verification script

6. Add `clipPlan` structured arguments to compound/assembly tools
7. Add source monitor control tools
8. Add a setup doctor / validation script
9. Submit to awesome-mcp-servers lists and glama.ai
10. Consider npm distribution for the TypeScript bridge component

### Medium-term (strategic)
11. ElevenLabs or similar TTS integration for AI voiceover workflows
