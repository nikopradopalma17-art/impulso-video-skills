## Unreleased

---

## 2026-09-08 (v0.20.1)

Patch release. v0.20.0 shipped with two tools that aborted with a `NameError`
before doing any work; both are fixed here.

### Fixed
- **Codex and Kiro migrations** (`scripts/migrate_to_codex.py`,
  `scripts/migrate_to_kiro.py`) — `write_text()` was dropped by the
  `_migrate_common` extraction without being moved to the shared module, so
  `--force` aborted with `NameError: name 'write_text' is not defined` on the
  first real write. `--dry-run` returned before that path, which is why it went
  unnoticed. Restored in `_migrate_common`, and the two orphaned function bodies
  the same refactor left stranded are gone. Thanks @Anai-Guo (#85).
- **`tools/dewatermark.py --setup`** — `setup_runpod()` called
  `get_runpod_config()`, which is defined nowhere in the repo, so the documented
  one-time setup crashed immediately. Now uses the `load_dotenv()` +
  `os.getenv("RUNPOD_API_KEY")` pattern `tools/upscale.py` already uses (#86).
- **`_migrate_common.load_mapping`** returned raw JSON instead of the normalized
  shape, so any caller would `KeyError` on `mapping["skip_commands"]`. It was
  unreachable only because both scripts shadowed it with a local copy. The real
  version is now shared and the duplicates (plus a duplicate `find_repo_root`
  and an unused `yaml_quote` import) are gone — verified byte-identical
  migration output before and after (#86).

### Added
- **`Lint Python` CI workflow** — gates on undefined names
  (`ruff --select F821,F811,F822,F823`) across `scripts/` and `tools/`.
  Deliberately narrow: only rules where a hit is a real defect, not style. Run
  against the v0.20.0 tree it reports 26 errors, including both `write_text`
  sites. There was previously no Python lint in CI (#86).

---

## 2026-08-31 (v0.20.0)

### Added
- **SoulX-FlashHead talking head** (`tools/soulx.py` + `docker/modal-soulx/`) — the toolkit's
  default talking head generator (Soul AI Lab, Apache 2.0, 1.3B), Modal-only. Preserves the
  input aspect ratio, so 16:9 presenter images come back 16:9 with no `--preprocess`
  workaround, and `--size` snaps to the model's latent grid while keeping the aspect. It is
  the default because identity holds over a long take: measured at **97% of frame-zero
  sharpness at 70s, flat across 72 segments**, so per-scene generation is a choice rather
  than a workaround. ~$0.0024 per second of output against SadTalker's ~$0.0014. Decision
  table in CLAUDE.md, full detail in `docs/soulx.md`. (#81)

### Changed
- **`docker/modal-soulx/` keeps its weights in a Modal Volume**, unlike the other Modal apps
  which bake them into the image. Measured: redeploy after a code change is ~2.3s against
  79-385s baked, while cold start and generation speed are unchanged. Needs a one-off
  `modal run …::populate_weights` (14.7 GB). The settled apps stay baked.
- Upstream repo ref and both model revisions in `modal-soulx` pinned by SHA — weights in a
  Volume aren't tied to the image, so nothing else prevents drift. (same lesson as #71/#74)
- **`NarratorPiP`** honours its `objectPosition` prop, which was declared and documented but
  silently ignored by a hardcoded value, and gains an `objectFit` prop (default `contain`,
  unchanged behaviour).
- `tools/cloud_gpu.py` learned `soulx`, including its GPU tier, so its jobs report a cost
  estimate.

### Removed
- **EchoMimicV3** (`tools/echomimic3.py`, `docker/modal-echomimic3/`, `docs/echomimic3.md`),
  added earlier in this unreleased cycle and never part of a tagged release. Identity drift
  made it unusable for real narration: on a controlled A/B — same photo, same 80s audio,
  same 544x736 — it fell to 50% of frame-zero sharpness by 70s, collapsing to a featureless
  smear, where SoulX-FlashHead held 97%. The failure is absorbing rather than gradual, since
  each segment re-anchors on the previous one's output, so it could not be tuned out; it
  implied a ~30s render ceiling that shaped the surrounding design. SoulX supersedes it on
  every axis that mattered — drift, cost (~3.7x cheaper), wall clock (~3-6x faster) — while
  keeping aspect-ratio preservation. (#81, closes #80)

---

## 2026-08-27 (v0.19.0)

### Added
- **uv is the install path** — `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`; `uv sync` (extras: `whisper`, `modal`, `youtube`) and every doc/tool now says `uv run tools/…`. `tools/requirements.txt` stays as the pip fallback. Contributed by @AsharibAli (#33, rebased as #59).
- **Kiro CLI support** — `scripts/migrate_to_kiro.py` installs the toolkit's skills/commands for Kiro with steering-file generation; see `docs/kiro.md`. Contributed by @homeo26 (#55). Follow-up refactor tracked in #58.
- **Version maintenance (closes #23)** — `scripts/check_versions.py` (toolkit-wide Remotion/Python/toolkit staleness, wired into `/versions`); `tests/render-baseline/` + `scripts/render-baseline.mjs` + `render-baseline.yml` (same-runner before/after render diff that gates Remotion bumps in CI); `scripts/bump_remotion.py` as `/versions --bump-toolkit`; grouped monthly Dependabot for the `remotion` group. (#63, #64, #65)
- **`sync_timing.py` generic mode** — pairs any `*AudioFile` with `*DurationSeconds` so ticket-driven and future config layouts work without tool changes. (#62)
- **Community add-ons** README section for integrations that live in their own repos (first entry: VOICEPEAK offline Japanese TTS, #42), plus CONTRIBUTING guidance for single-vendor integrations and automated/AI-generated PRs. (#60, #61)

### Changed
- **Remotion 4.0.425 → 4.0.518** across all templates, examples, showcases and the baseline harness — first bump gated by the render-baseline check (all frames identical). (#67)
- All Remotion projects now pin the same exact version (four stragglers were on 4.0.381/4.0.382/`^4.0.0`).

### Housekeeping
- External PR queue triaged: MiniMax video/music and Atlas Cloud bot PRs closed under the new policy; Edge-TTS (#46) has review feedback pending.
- Stale branches removed; unmerged experiments preserved as `archive/*` tags.

---

## 2026-08-26 (v0.18.0)

### Added
- **YouTube publishing** — `tools/youtube_upload.py` + `/publish` command. OAuth login (`--auth`), private-by-default upload, scheduled go-live (`--publish-at`), thumbnails, `--dry-run` validation, 403s classified by API reason. Setup guide in `docs/youtube-upload.md`; google-* deps are opt-in in `tools/requirements.txt`. (#29, #37, #38, #39, #40)
- **60db TTS provider** — third `voiceover.py --provider 60db` backend plus standalone `tools/sixtydb_tts.py` (synthesize / stream / websocket transports, `--list-voices`). Unified 0-1 voice settings auto-convert to 60db's 0-100 scale; `redub.py --tts-provider 60db`. Brands carry a `sixtydb` block in `voice.json`. (#27)
- **`_internal/narrative-patterns.md`** — Discovery Story structure for sprint reviews (reorder by narrative arc, turning-point slides, honest bridge framing).
- **`docs/ltx2.md` Windows gotchas** + LTX-2 Modal config wired into `verify_setup.py`. (#51, #53)

### Changed
- **Remotion skills sync** now tracks upstream's new per-topic layout via `skills/remotion-best-practices/` (router skill embedding markup/maps/captions/render/saas/studio/docs/upgrade). Workflow fails loudly on the next re-layout and carries the upstream skill version in PR titles. First sync from the new layout: 39 → 137 files. (#56)
- **Modal image-edit** requests A100-80GB (OOMed on 40GB).
- `.gitignore` covers `scratch/`, Playwright run artifacts, recursive `assets/voices`; duplicate project copies under `projects/` untracked.

### Fixed
- Weekly Remotion skills sync had failed every run since 2026-07-13 (upstream directory moved).
- `verify_setup.py` accepts both `modal` CLI JSON key casings when detecting deployed apps.

### Registry
- Added missing entries: `align_captions` tool, `quick-spot` / `data-viz-chart` / `ds-crt-stinger` / `sky-blue-short` examples. `the-space-between` marked showcase-only (no source directory).

---

## 2026-06-10 (v0.17.0)

### Added
- **concept-explainer-short template** — 9:16 vertical TikTok/Reels/Shorts explainers. First pure Python/moviepy template: `scenes.json` → `gen_vo.py` (per-scene TTS) → `gen_captions.py` (whisper forced-align) → `build.py` (Ken Burns stills, boomerang clips, karaoke caption pills, ducked music). (#31)
- **`examples/sky-blue-short`** — 52s showcase of the template with all assets committed.
- **TTS pacing QC** — `tools/pacing.py`; `voiceover.py` and `qwen3_tts.py` report per-take `wpm` + `pacing` label and accept `--max-wpm` for a pitch-preserving atempo clamp. Fixes cloned voices inheriting a rushed pace from their reference. (#30)

### Docs
- README restructured to lead with finished videos; "Using with Codex" moved to `docs/codex.md`.

---

## 2026-06-08 (v0.16.0)

### Added
- **Ideogram 4 text-to-image** — `tools/ideogram4.py` + `ideogram4` skill. Structured JSON captions for legible in-image text and exact brand colours; hosted paid API. FLUX-vs-Ideogram decision rule added to CLAUDE.md. (#28)
- **Qwen3-TTS v0.2** — VoiceDesign mode (`--design-instruct`), shared-prompt cloning for consistent multi-scene narration, `clone.design` brand schema with self-caching reference; `tools/align_captions.py` (Scribe-based caption timing alignment).
- **Codex migration flow** for toolkit skills/commands (#16, thanks @kimhoontae-gogo); thin `AGENTS.md`.

### Changed
- Remotion pinned to exact versions in lab examples; CLAUDE.md clarifies the `<OffthreadVideo>` choice vs upstream `@remotion/media`.
- Official Remotion skills synced (upstream 277510e). (#17)
- GitHub Actions bumped to Node 24-compatible versions; docker-build workflow handles multi-commit pushes and skips `modal-*` dirs.

### Fixed
- Python 3.9 compatibility restored across `tools/` via `from __future__ import annotations`. (#22)
- `modal-upscale` basicsr build conflict. (#19, thanks @ATECHPCS)
- Codex migration name read from registry; no-op skip entry dropped. (closes #20)

---

## 2026-04-21 (v0.15.0)

### Added
- **LTX-2 style LoRA support** with `crt-terminal` preset.
- **`examples/ds-crt-stinger`** — 6s CRT LoRA + grunged-logo brand stinger.
- Animated synthwave README banner (`showcase/banner`).

### Changed
- Official Remotion skills synced (upstream 41a3b06); "Stsrt" → "Start" typo fixed. (#14)

---

## 2026-04-09 (v0.14.2)

### Added
- **moviepy skill** (`.claude/skills/moviepy/`) — Python video composition for overlaying deterministic text on AI-generated video (LTX-2, SadTalker). Leads with the "trustworthy text" framing: news, trailers, lower thirds, and social captions all need deterministic overlay because AI models can't guarantee readable text. Covers the PIL workaround for moviepy 2.x's TextClip ascender-clipping bug, audio-anchored timelines, common recipes (labels on LTX-2 clips, lower thirds on SadTalker heads, tinted overlays for contrast, split-screen composites, music + VO mixing), 2.x API gotchas, and a genres-where-this-shines table.
- **`examples/quick-spot`** — runnable 15-second ad-style moviepy example. Audio-anchored timeline, PIL text rendering with cross-platform font loading, optional per-scene VO + ducked music, solid-colour backgrounds. Renders with `python3 build.py` and zero external assets.
- **`examples/data-viz-chart`** — runnable animated time-series chart (real GitHub star history) demonstrating the "matplotlib for data + moviepy for trustworthy text" split that mirrors real news-graphics pipelines. Cache-aware matplotlib step.
- **`examples/hello-world`** — minimal Remotion sprint-review example finally committed. The root README's quick-start callout has been pointing at `cd examples/hello-world && npm install && npm run render` since Feb 23, but the example had zero git history on any branch. Fixes the broken link for anyone cloning the repo.
- **LTX-2 skill: Stylized Character Cameo** — new use case in `.claude/skills/ltx2/SKILL.md` documenting LTX-2 image-to-video as a SadTalker alternative for non-photoreal faces (fantasy characters, heavy beards, masks, helmets) where lip-sync precision matters less than motion + atmosphere.
- **CLAUDE.md: Audio-Anchored Timelines** — new subsection in the Video Timing guide complementing the existing reactive `sync_timing.py` flow with a prevention-first pattern (generate audio first, anchor visuals to absolute timestamps). Especially useful for single-file moviepy `build.py` projects.

### Changed
- **`tools/requirements.txt`** adds `Pillow>=10.0`, `moviepy>=2.0`, `matplotlib>=3.7`. One install command (`python3 -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt`) now covers every Python feature in the toolkit: AI voiceover, image gen, music gen, and the new moviepy examples.
- **Root README quick-start** switches to `python3 -m pip install` — the [PyPA-recommended invocation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#running-pip) that works identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows and guarantees `pip` and `python3` resolve to the same environment.
- **`docs/sadtalker.md`** adds a "When NOT to Use SadTalker" section pointing at LTX-2 image-to-video for stylized characters, heavy facial hair, masks, and non-frontal angles.
- **`examples/README.md`** splits "Using Examples" into Remotion (`npm install` flow) and moviepy (`python3 build.py` flow) sections and adds both new examples to the listing table.

### Fixed
- **Hardcoded macOS font paths in `examples/quick-spot/build.py` and `examples/data-viz-chart/build.py`** — both examples used `/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Arial Bold.ttf` directly, which would crash with `FileNotFoundError` on Linux and Windows. Replaced with a `platform.system()`-keyed fallback chain that tries OS-appropriate sans-serif fonts (Arial on macOS and Windows, DejaVu Sans on Linux, with multiple candidate paths each) and falls back to `ImageFont.load_default()` if nothing matches, so the examples never crash on unusual setups. Both examples now genuinely run cross-platform as their READMEs promise.
- **Latent Pillow gap in `tools/flux2.py` and `tools/image_edit.py`** — both tools imported PIL inside a `try/except ImportError` guard with a friendly error message, but Pillow was never actually declared in `tools/requirements.txt`. Users had to install Pillow manually after hitting the runtime error. Free-rider fix via the moviepy declaration.
- **Guarded imports** added to both moviepy example `build.py` files — matches the existing `flux2.py` / `image_edit.py` friendly-error pattern. Prevents bare `ModuleNotFoundError` tracebacks for users who run the examples before installing dependencies.

### Docs
- **README examples table** adds `q2-townhall-longarm-ad` (Super Bowl-style launch ad with LTX-2 animated Lugh cameo) and `q2-townhall-stars` (GitHub star history time-lapse) as finished demo entries dated 2026-04-08.
- **moviepy skill** added to the README's skills table and `_internal/toolkit-registry.json`.

---

## 2026-04-04 (v0.14.1)

### Added
- **`tools/chain_video.py`** — Chain LTX-2 clips with visual continuity (each scene uses previous clip's last frame as input). Supports per-scene prompts via JSON, auto-resume of interrupted runs, and structured progress reporting.
- **Structured progress reporting** (`--progress json`) for all cloud GPU tools
- **OpenClaw skill: yieldMs polling** — agent stays in poll loop for live progress instead of going silent with `background:true`
- **OpenClaw skill: style drift prevention** — rules to prevent anime/Asian style drift in chained LTX-2 sequences (per-scene prompts + negative prompts)

### Changed
- **acemusic cloud API** is now default music generation provider (official API, XL Turbo 4B model with 5Hz LM thinking)
- **SadTalker timeouts** increased: 20x multiplier + 300s buffer for size=512+gfpgan on A10G
- Synced official Remotion skills (upstream d5d3955)

### Fixed
- chain_video: glob matching for manually-renamed clips (e.g. `chain-05-brigid.mp4`)
- chain_video: 20-min subprocess timeout, stderr in error messages, JSON validation, temp file cleanup
- chain_video: registered in toolkit-registry.json
- R2 recovery note for SadTalker client timeouts

---

## 2026-03-26 (v0.13.2)

### Changed
- **Default cloud provider switched to Modal** — All 6 cloud GPU tools (flux2, image_edit, music_gen, qwen3_tts, sadtalker, voiceover) now default to `--cloud modal` instead of `--cloud runpod`. RunPod remains available via `--cloud runpod`.

### Fixed
- Remove unused imports in `tools/ltx2.py` (`json`, `requests`) — flagged by code quality bot

---

## 2026-03-25 (v0.13.1)

### Added
- **`tools/ltx2.py`** — AI video generation using LTX-2.3 22B DiT model

  - Image-to-video — animate still images with motion prompts
  - Joint audio+video generation (synchronized ambient audio)
  - Quality presets: `standard` (30 steps) and `fast` (15 steps)
  - Valid frame counts: 25-193 frames ((n-1)%8==0), 24fps default

  - Estimated cost: ~$0.23 per 5-second clip
- **LTX-2 skill** (`.claude/skills/ltx2/`) — prompting guide, parameters, video production use cases
- **Openclaw skill updated** — LTX-2 added as section 4d (video clips), setup instructions, cost table

### Technical Notes
- `torch.inference_mode()` required around pipeline call — without it, Gemma text encoder retains ~37GB of autograd activations causing OOM (upstream bug: Lightricks/LTX-2#152)
- Weights hosted on `Lightricks/LTX-2.3` HuggingFace repo (separate from the code repo `Lightricks/LTX-2`)
- `transformers` pinned to 4.57.6 (5.x breaks `Gemma3TextConfig.rope_local_base_freq`)
- HuggingFace token required for both LTX-2 (rate limiting) and Gemma 3 (gated model)

- **Cancel on exit** — Jobs are cancelled on RunPod when client polling times out (previously left orphaned jobs in queue indefinitely)
- **R2 upload support** — flux2.py and image_edit.py now pass R2 config to handlers (was already supported server-side but never triggered)

### Changed
- **flux2 default GPU** — Changed from ADA_24 (RTX 4090, frequently throttled) to AMPERE_24,ADA_24 (fallback chain)
