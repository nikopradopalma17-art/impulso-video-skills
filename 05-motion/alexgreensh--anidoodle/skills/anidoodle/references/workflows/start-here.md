# Start here: agree the piece with the person, then build

anidoodle makes many kinds of thing in many hands. Nothing about a piece is fixed in advance:
not its length, its shape, its style or its sound. So the first job is to find out what this
person wants, quickly, one question at a time, and to fill every gap with a stated default
instead of a guess.

## The intake (ask only what the request leaves open)

Ask one question per turn, with short options and your recommendation first. If they say "you
pick", pick, say what you picked and why in one line, and carry on.

1. **What are you making?** A still, a loop, a picture that draws itself, a story film, an
   explainer, an infographic, a launch or product video, an interactive web piece, a drawing
   lesson, a character, or a style matched from their image. The table in `SKILL.md` routes each
   one to its workflow file.
2. **Which style?** Show the gallery (https://github.com/alexgreensh/anidoodle/blob/main/skills/anidoodle/assets/styles.jpg, one tile per hand; the list with
   each hand's medium is `references/styles/INDEX.md`). Recommend two or three hands that suit the
   subject and the audience, with one reason each. Offer two other routes:
   - **"Match my image"**: they bring a picture and you adapt its hand (`adapt-a-style.md`).
   - **"A house style"**: they already picked one before; load it from `styles/house/`.
3. **What shape and where will it live?** Square `1x1`, vertical `9x16`, wide `16x9`, portrait
   `4x5`, or any W x H they name. One source can ship several shapes (`references/formats.md`).
4. **How long?** Any length. A three-second sticker, a ninety-second story, a five-minute
   explainer, a twenty-minute lesson. Never cap it and never assume it. Long pieces get chapters
   (`long-film.md`).
5. **Sound?** Silent, or a score: name a music style and a mood per section
   (`references/music/`). Their own voice-over or track is theirs to bring; anidoodle composes
   and synthesizes everything else.
6. **Characters?** A new one (build it once, `character-consistency.md`), one they already have
   in a module, or one from their image (reference, embedded only if they ask).

Stop asking the moment you can build. Two questions answered well beat six asked.

## Defaults when they do not say

| Open question | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Style | the hand whose recipe best fits the subject, named with a reason | a style is a decision, not a coin toss |
| Shape | `1x1` for social, `16x9` for web heroes and YouTube, `9x16` for Reels/Shorts/TikTok | where it lives decides it |
| Length | still: one frame; loop: 4-8 s; story film: long enough for its arc; explainer: one idea per chapter | the content sets the length, not a template |
| Sound | a film gets a score in the style that fits its mood; a loop or still is silent | silence is a choice too |
| fps | 30 (24 for a hand-drawn cartoon feel, 12 on twos for paper and stop-motion) | the medium's own rhythm |

## Write it down before you draw

One short brief file in the project: kind, style (and why), shape(s), length, sound (style +
moods), characters, the one-sentence idea. Everything the person said goes in their words.
Everything you decided is marked as yours so they can veto it in one line.

## Before the first full render

- **Show options as one still sheet** when a choice is open (a transition, a lettering medium,
  a palette): three to six variants side by side, picked in one message. Then render.
- **Review stills for design**, not only for things overlapping (`references/craft-bar.md`).
- **A picture that draws itself says so**: `kind: "drawing"` in the film's `meta`. A stipple dot
  or a hatch changes far less than 0.5 % of the frame, so without it the gate calls a drawing
  dead air; with it, dead air is judged over 1 s at a 0.02 % floor and a hand may rest half a
  second between passes. `meta: { title, W, H, fps, bpm, durationFrames, kind: "drawing" }`.

## Alive means real motion

When someone asks for a subject to be "alive", "swimming" or "moving", an in-place loop reads as
a GIF. The subject travels through a world that changes as it moves, and the camera follows.
The worked example is the koi: `koi.ts` takes an optional `KoiLive` (time, amplitude, a pose on
a path) and `koiWorld.ts` swims it through a pond much bigger than the frame, sliding under pads
that are placed in the world, its wake spreading from its nose.

The pattern:
1. **Add motion as an optional input** to the subject's drawing function (`live?: KoiLive`).
   With it absent, the code path is the still, untouched.
2. **Guard the still**: render the still plate before and after with `still.mjs` and compare
   the md5 it prints. The still must stay pixel-identical; if it moves, the refactor leaked.
3. **Place the world in world units**, not screen units, so the scenery changes as the subject
   moves; let the camera follow (`references/camera.md`).
4. **Frame 0 of the living version equals the still** (same pose, same framing), so a film can
   hand over from the still card to the living one without a seam.
