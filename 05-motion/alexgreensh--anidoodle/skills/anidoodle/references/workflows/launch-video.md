# Launch and product videos

A launch video makes one promise about a product and shows it being kept. It is a short film
with a job: in the first seconds the viewer knows what the thing is, by the end they know where
to get it. Every rule below was paid for on anidoodle's own 77 s launch film (four cuts) and
checked against published launch-video craft. The reusable pieces are in `launch-video-kit.md`;
a template film renders a 16 s launch for any product from data.

## Inputs the person brings

Product screenshots, a logo, UI captures, a repo link, a feature list, the exact install or
sign-up line. Images they bring may be embedded (pinned by sha256, provenance in the manifest);
everything around them is drawn in code. Never generate or fetch images.

## Ground it in the real product first

Before any storyboarding, write a short sourced brief and get ONE approval on it. A launch film
that invents its subject draws a mascot of a product, not the product.

1. **Read the real thing.** The screenshots and captures they brought, the repo's README and UI
   components, the live page. Note the two or three REAL features a viewer should recognise on
   screen, the exact product name and mark, the brand colours as hex.
2. **Collect approved claims.** The one-line promise and any numbers come from their own
   materials (site copy, release notes, README), each with its source next to it. Anything you
   cannot source becomes a question, not a line in the film. List the claims the film must NOT make.
3. **Ask the grounding questions**, one message: which features to show (recommend your three),
   which shapes to ship, where it will run, the exact CTA lines.
4. **Write the brief** where the film's files live: product and promise, features with sources,
   brand colours mapped onto palette roles, approved and banned claims, shapes, platforms. The
   storyboard and every word on screen quote the brief, never memory.

## Made for this product, every frame and every note

The film's pictures are drawn for this product's subject in the style recipe the brief picked
(`references/styles.md`); its score is written for this brief. anidoodle's own plates and
pieces are examples of the craft, never material for someone else's film.

## The story

- **One sentence the film proves**, written before anything else. anidoodle's: "you can create
  images, illustrations, loops, animations and films in pure code." Every beat serves it. A row
  of features is a spec sheet, not a story.
- **Told from the user's point of view**: they type, press the button, the result appears. The
  viewer should picture themselves doing it.
- **Say what it is in the first five seconds** (anidoodle: "no image model, just code" by 10 s at
  the latest). The hook lands inside 2-3 s and reads with the sound OFF: feeds autoplay muted.
- **Arc**: hook, one core interaction, a fast proof of range (a wall, never a slow tour), the
  brand moment, the call. A visual payoff every 3-5 s; no dead waits.
- **No footnotes, no eyebrow text, no terminal jargon on screen** unless the product is one.

## Type

- **Words NEVER sit over the art or the UI.** A word gets its own full frame: an ink bloom
  opens, a brush writes the word, the bloom closes on the next scene (`typeFrame`). Corner marks
  step aside when the camera brings UI under them.
- **3-7 words a frame, few frames.** Collapse word cards into one claim then proof ("JUST CODE."
  then "31 STYLES"); fewer cards leave more time for the proof.
- **Hold each settled word 0.5 s or more**, longer for the claim.
- **Judge DESIGN in review stills, not only collisions**: hierarchy, spacing, whether the frame
  would pass as a poster. A frame with nothing overlapping can still be ugly.

## Motion

- **Every transition is a gentle move**: bloom, card flip, push, the card GROWS into the frame.
  Never a hard cut, never a sharp swoosh. Ease in and out; the camera is `references/camera.md`.
- **Drawings play 3-6x faster than real time**; a loop is held long enough to see it loop.
- **Alive means real motion**: the koi swims through a scrolling world, not an in-place GIF
  (`start-here.md`, "Alive means real motion").
- **Chat is a real thread**: the request appears BEFORE its result, earlier answers stay, the
  thread scrolls, a follow-up animates in the existing card instead of popping a new one.
- **Web**: show the whole site first, then zoom to each click; the site's copy describes what
  the viewer is seeing.
- Banned defaults: a centred title on a gradient, everything fading in, bouncy easing, particle
  bursts, glow on UI chrome, dead time, text scaled into blur.

## Brand and the end card

- **The logo recurs**: a small corner mark on every frame (`logoBug`), not once at the start.
- **The end card is composed for the frame**: the name, one line, the exact install lines in a
  panel, held **3 s or more** so a viewer can screenshot them. anidoodle's are both lines:
  `/plugin marketplace add alexgreensh/anidoodle` and
  `/plugin install anidoodle@alexgreensh-anidoodle`. One primary call; the link smaller below.

## Sound

- **Music first, heard as an mp3 by a human** before it scores anything (you cannot hear it).
  Write it for THIS brand: pick the style and a mood per section from the brief (energy,
  audience, where it runs), then write the notes (`references/music/README.md`); `music.mjs check`
  must pass. Never reuse our score or a stock piece.
- **Balance by stem RMS, not only LUFS**: an integrated -14 LUFS hid a sub 7-10 dB too hot.
- **Cut on downbeats, not every beat.** Land the claim on a chord (launch3's lands on bar 26,
  the home chord); `beatGrid().solve()` fits a flexible segment so it does.
- **Sound effects only on real direction changes**: one riser into the big reveal, one impact,
  never a whoosh on every cut (`references/music/sound-design.md`).
- **Master to -14 LUFS integrated, true peak -1 dBTP or lower**, then listen on a phone speaker.

## Delivery

- **Length**: about 60 s for a launch post (LinkedIn, YouTube, the README); 15-45 s for X; cut
  a platform version rather than pushing one master everywhere. Cut whole beats; never speed
  the whole film up (it breaks the beat grid and reads rushed).
- **Shapes**: `16x9` for YouTube and the site, `1x1` or `4x5` for feeds, `9x16` for Reels and
  Shorts. Reframe per shape; never crop a wide render. The template renders 16:9 today, and the
  other shapes from it are coming. A film built from the parts can target any size now: set
  `meta.W`/`meta.H` and lay it out for that frame (`launch-video-kit.md`).
- **The first frame is the thumbnail.** Platforms and players show frame 1 before play. Make
  it legible and on brand (anidoodle's is the wall of styles; the template's is the prompt, big,
  mid-sentence); never a blank, a fade from black, or a whole chat window too small to read.
  If the story opens quiet, render with `--poster-frame N` (frame 0 shows frame N and dissolves
  into the opening by frame 6), and ship only what passes `verify-export --delivery`.

## The process

1. **Story sentence** and the sourced brief. ✋ One approval.
2. **Storyboard**: one line per beat with its length in beats, the words, the transition.
3. **Options sheet**: transitions and type styles side by side as one cheap still sheet (e.g.
   three blooms, three lettering media). The person picks; nothing is rendered in full yet.
4. **One still per scene**, at 0.3-0.5 scale on a contact sheet, reviewed for design:
   `still.mjs <film> --frames 0,240,610 --sheet out/scenes.jpg` draws them all in one browser
   (`references/working-method.md`).
5. **Music as an mp3 on a page**, heard by a human. ✋ Approval.
6. **Cut as data**: content scenes on one timeline, the cut as `pic`/`type` segments on the
   beat grid (`launchCut.ts`). Re-timing edits the list, never scene code.
7. **Review from the render**: contact sheets per beat, cuts as before/after pairs, DESIGN
   first (type over art, spacing, hierarchy), then timing. Render only the changed range
   (`render.mjs --from F --to T` writes `out/<film>.<F>-<T>.mp4`, silent). Give notes in camera words ("slow this zoom to 0.7x",
   "hold the word 10 frames longer"), never "make it better".
8. **QA**: `gate.mjs <film>` (determinism, contract, dead air; declare real holds in
   `meta.holds`, each with its reason) and `verify-export.mjs <film> --file <mp4> --delivery
   --first-frame #rrggbb` for EVERY shape shipped; meter the mix. Keep the review page updated as work lands.
9. ✋ **Final approval** on the finished file.
