# Formats: what you are making, and how each one ships

Everything is a `Film`: meta, shots that tile `[0, duration)`, and optionally a score. A still
is a film one frame long, so every tool works on every format. Scaffold the kind you need:

```bash
node <skill>/engine/tools/scaffold.mjs ~/art --still hero      # a picture
node <skill>/engine/tools/scaffold.mjs ~/art --film intro      # something that moves
```

## Stills: hero art, spots, covers, cards, diagrams

- **Size is `meta.W` x `meta.H`**, in logical units; `--scale` multiplies it at render time, so
  one source gives a thumbnail (`--scale 0.5`), the page (`1`) and print (`--scale 3`). Common
  shapes: 1600x900 web hero, 1200x630 social card, 1080x1080 square post, 1080x1350 portrait
  post, 2550x3300 letter at 300 dpi.
- **`node tools/still.mjs hero --out out/hero.png`** draws it twice and prints `reproducible`
  when both hashes agree. That line is the receipt that the same file will come back tomorrow.
  Several frames of a moving piece in one browser: `--frames 0,450,900` (or `0-900:150`), with
  `--sheet out/sheet.jpg` for a contact sheet at 0.4 scale (`working-method.md`).
- **Transparent background**: skip the paper fill and the page stays clear, so a spot
  illustration or an icon drops onto any website colour. Leave `g.paper()` off as well: over
  clear pixels it lays its grain down as a grey veil. Carry the tooth in the marks instead
  (`ink` and `paint` groups texture themselves).
- **A series** is one draw function and many seeds or parameters: a set of blog headers, a card
  per team member, a family of empty states. Put the variation in a table at the top of the
  module and render each row; `styleGallery.ts` shows how several plates compose onto one sheet.
- **An explainer or infographic** still: draw the thing, then label it with `drafting.ts`
  `letter()` and leader lines drawn with `g.pen`. Numbers are content, so every figure on the
  plate comes from a named source in a comment beside it.

The approval gate for a still is the still itself: one render, a written self-critique against
the craft table, then show it.

## Motion without a story: loops, stickers, logos, ambient art

- **Seamless loop**: drive everything from `t = local / DURATION` through functions that repeat
  a whole number of times over `[0, 1)` (`sin(2 * PI * k * t)`, integer `k`). Frame `DURATION`
  then equals frame 0 and the seam disappears. Check it: render the last frame and frame 0 and
  compare them to a mid-loop neighbour pair, or run `node tools/verify-export.mjs <name> --loop`
  on the rendered file, which judges the last-to-first step against the loop's own mid-loop
  deltas.
- **Animated logo / sticker**: 2 to 4 seconds, the mark DRAWN on (`progress` on `g.pen`,
  `letter`), a settle, a small idle. Leave the background unpainted for transparency.
- **Ambient / idle art** (a site header that breathes, a banner): the subject never stops; the
  motion is small and everywhere. `banner.ts` is the worked example.
- **Dead air still applies**: the gate measures it on any piece longer than one frame.

## Films: the story ones

30 to 90 seconds, a transformation, a score, the full workflow in `SKILL.md`, the doctrine in
`storytelling.md`, `music/README.md` and `working-method.md`. `example/` is the worked one.

## Delivering

| Output | Command | For |
|---|---|---|
| PNG | `node tools/still.mjs <name> --out out/x.png [--scale 2]` | stills, print, anything static |
| MP4 | `node tools/render.mjs <name>` | films with their score, social video |
| GIF | `node tools/render.mjs <name> --out out/x.gif [--width 640] [--gif-fps 15]` | loops, README heroes, email |
| WebM | `node tools/render.mjs <name> --out out/x.webm [--width 512]` | stickers and overlays, alpha kept (VP9) |
| APNG | `node tools/render.mjs <name> --out out/x.apng [--width 512]` | alpha loops that play in every browser |
| HTML | `node tools/emit.mjs <name> --out out/x.html` | the piece itself: one offline file that redraws it, with sound, on a double-click |

Render options that hold for every moving format:

- `--poster-frame N [--poster-fade 6]`: platforms show frame 0 as the thumbnail. The file opens
  on frame N (the wall of styles, the logo, the prompt written big) and dissolves into the real
  opening by frame 6. The frame count and the score are unchanged. A delivery whose frame 0 is
  near-blank gets a warning after the encode.
- `--blur N`: motion blur, each output frame the average of N subframes over a one-frame shutter,
  in linear light and weighted by alpha (so a transparent WebM or APNG gets no dark fringe). Held
  frames come out unchanged; stepped art (`meta.step` > 1, `onTwos`) is never blurred.
- `--from F --to T`: frames `[F, T)` only, silent, written to `out/<name>.<F>-<T>.<ext>`, never
  over the finished film. For checking a passage, not for shipping.
- `--hashes out/x.md5`: the md5 of every frame handed to the encoder, for frame-exact
  comparisons of two renders before any codec blurs the difference.

After any encode, `node tools/verify-export.mjs <name> [--first-frame #hex] [--fidelity-psnr 40]`
proves the file on disk is the film: size, exact frame count, duration, the score (an audio
stream exactly when the film has one, as long as the picture, not silent), and optionally the
first frame's average colour and its fidelity to the source frame (`--frame N` picks which
frame `--fidelity-psnr` compares; default 0). All of it is opt-in beyond the container facts,
so transparent and non-uniform pieces pass cleanly. For a file that ships, add `--delivery`: a
near-blank frame 0 then FAILS instead of warning; the fix is `render --poster-frame N`.

A still needs a browser only (`npx playwright-core install chromium`). Anything that moves also needs
`ffmpeg`. `gate.mjs` runs on all of them and marks the checks that do not apply to the piece,
a silent loop's audio or a still's dead air, as `----` rather than passing them.
