# The launch kit: build your product's launch film

The pieces anidoodle's own launch film is made of, in `engine/src/canvas-core/`, usable for any
product. The rules they serve are in `launch-video.md`.

## Start from the template (16 s, 16:9, one file)

`launchTemplate.ts` turns data into a film, 1920x1080 (16:9; square, 4:5 and 9:16 from the
template are coming): two or three prompts answered by plates drawing
themselves in a chat thread, a type frame between them, and an end card with your install lines.
`launchExample.ts` is a complete one for a made-up product. Copy its shape, not its contents:
the plates and the score are the product's own, made for its brief.

```ts
import { C } from "./launchKit";
import { makeLaunchFilm } from "./launchTemplate";
import { dashboardSketch, onboardingSketch } from "./myProductPlates"; // drawn for YOUR subject
import { myProductScore } from "./myProductScore";                      // a Piece written for YOUR brief

export const myLaunch = makeLaunchFilm({
  title: "Your Product", subtitle: "the one line it lives by",
  asks: [
    { prompt: "sketch my dashboard, as a print", plate: dashboardSketch, label: "print · drawn in code" },
    { prompt: "now the onboarding screen", plate: onboardingSketch, label: "a second answer, same thread" },
  ],
  words: [[{ text: "IDEA IN.", style: "ink", color: C.ink }, { text: "ART OUT.", style: "ink", color: C.accent }]],
  tagline: "One sentence that says what it is",
  install: ["npm install your-product", "your-product init"],
  bpm: 96, // the tempo of the score you wrote; the brief sets it, there is no default
  askBeats: 6, typeBeats: 4, endBeats: 8, claimBar: 4,
  score: myProductScore, // or null for a silent film
});
```

Add `src/hosts/page-myLaunch.ts` (three lines, copy `page-launchExample.ts`), then:

```bash
node tools/still.mjs myLaunch --frame 0 --out out/poster.png   # the first frame is the thumbnail
node tools/still.mjs myLaunch --frames 0-420:30 --sheet out/sheet.jpg   # the cut on one sheet, one browser
node tools/render.mjs myLaunch                  # --poster-frame N if frame 0 is quiet
node tools/gate.mjs myLaunch
node tools/verify-export.mjs myLaunch --file out/myLaunch.mp4 --delivery
```

What you get: the first prompt already being typed at frame 0 in a close-up (a hook that reads
muted), the camera easing out for the press, an ink drop arcing from Generate into the thread
and blooming open into a card where the plate draws itself live, the thread keeping earlier
answers and scrolling, a gentle lean onto each new card, full-frame word pages between asks,
and the end card blooming open and holding. The corner mark (your name, hand-lettered) steps
aside before any lean. Real holds are declared, so the gate passes. Sync wins over length: the
score plays at the film's bpm exactly, so every cut sits on its downbeats, and the film is made
whole bars of the score (`gridScore`: the end-card hold, which is a hold, grows or shrinks to the
bar; the tail rings out in whole bars). A score in 4/4 with no pickup, starting on frame 0. If it
does not fit, the build throws and names the score lengths in bars that would, or change
askBeats/endBeats/claimBar. Render refuses a beat-grid film whose score is more
than 0.5 % off its bpm. The bed is set to -14 LUFS with the true peak at or under -1 dBTP
(`musicBed`); a dynamic piece stops at the peak ceiling first and render says how far short;
`limit: true` lets a look-ahead limiter take those peaks instead.

**The plates and the score are made for this product, every time.** A style is a recipe applied
to the user's subject (`references/styles.md`): draw their dashboard, their mascot, their
product's world in the chosen hand, as a still plus its `*Draw` film. anidoodle's own plates
(the lighthouse and fox in `launchExample.ts`) are placeholders, never a user's film. The score
is written for the brief's style, mood and length (`references/music/README.md`); `score` is
required (`null` means silent), `bpm` has no default, and the template refuses anidoodle's own
pieces, by identity, by title and by content (the same novelty gate `music.mjs check` runs).

| Spec field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `title`, `subtitle`, `placeholder`, `genLabel`, `accent` | the chat's name, subline, empty text, button word, button colour |
| `asks[]` | 1-3 of `{ prompt, plate, label, from?, to?, crop? }` |
| `words[i]` | the type frame after `asks[i]` (not after the last ask; it flows into the end card) |
| `tagline`, `install[]`, `footer` | the end card; install lines are shown exactly as given |
| `bpm` (required), `fps`, `askBeats`, `typeBeats`, `endBeats` | the beat grid (a beat is 60 x fps / bpm frames) and each part's length in beats |
| `claimBar` | land the end card on this bar's downbeat, counting from bar 0 (`claimBar: 4` = frame 4 x bar); throws if it cannot. A longer last ask is really longer, never slowed |
| `score` (required) or `audio` | the score written for this product (a function returning a `Piece`), as a bed; `null` for silence; or your own finished mix (not checked) |

The template refuses a feature list (more than 3 asks) and an end card too short to read.

## The parts, for a film of your own shape

A film built from the parts can be any size today: set its `meta.W` and `meta.H` (1080x1920 for
9:16) and pass the same `W` and `H` to `bloomFrame` and `typeFrame`, which default to 1920x1080.
`writeOn` and `useCam` follow the film's frame. `drawChatFrame` and the template's layout are
drawn for 1920x1080, so frame them with the camera; never crop a wide render.

**`launchKit.ts`**: timing and UI.
- Easing: `ramp`, `inOut`, `out3`, `in3`, `expo`, a closed-form `spring`, `press` (a button
  press that dips and springs back). Camera: `Cam`, `camLerp` (zoom travels in log space),
  `useCam`, `toScreen`. For longer camera work use `references/camera.md`.
- `plateLayer(env, key, film, frame, px)`: draw ANY film of this engine into an offscreen layer
  at any frame. This is composition without recordings: every plate in a launch film is the real
  plate drawn live by its own code. `selfLayer` is a scratch surface for a scene inside a scene.
- The chat: `drawChatFrame(ctx, state)` (window, composer, Generate; `title`, `subtitle`,
  `genLabel`, `accent` are yours), `charTimes`/`typedAt` (human typing), `caretAt`, `pointer`,
  `inkDrop` (the drop from the button to the card), `inkCard` (the answer card that blooms
  open), `artCard`, `softShadow`, `rr`.
- The ink: `blot(c, R, seed)` and `pathOf`, a seeded wobbling rim for blooms and drops.

**`kinetic.ts`**: lettering that is written, never set.
- `writeOn(ctx, env, text, x, y, size, p, style, opts)`: a line written stroke by stroke by a
  visible tool, in `ink`, `crayon`, `thread`, `chalk`, `brick` or `marker`. `measure` sizes it.
- `sentence` (one medium per word, one word per beat), `caption` (a small callout with an
  underline or arrow), `logo`/`logoCentred` and `logoBug` (anidoodle's own wordmark and corner
  mark; for your product, write your name with `writeOn` as the template does).

**`launchCut.ts`**: the cut as data.
- `pic(from, to, len)` plays a span of your content timeline over `len` frames; `type(lines,
  len, before, after)` is a word page. `makeCut(segs)` gives `N`, `at(F)`, `contentOf`, `cutOf`
  (map content-frame sound events onto the cut).
- `beatGrid(bpm, fps)`: `beat`, `bar`, `frameOf(bar, beat)`, and `solve(bar, fixed)`, the frames
  left for one flexible segment so the claim lands on a bar (launch3 lands on bar 26).
- `bloomFrame` (a page inside an ink bloom; `close: false` keeps it open for an end card),
  `typeFrame` (one to three lines written on it; `lead`, `stagger`), `bloomRadius` (for holds).

**`launchGallery.ts`**: `drawWall` and `wallCam`, a rolling wall of style cards where the
focus card GROWS toward the viewer instead of the camera zooming. The proof-of-range beat.

**`webTour.ts`**: a website drawn in code and toured: the whole page first, then the camera
zooms to each click, with the pointer and input log driving the page's own state.

## Worked example

`launch2.ts` is anidoodle's content timeline (chat, koi with its code streaming, the wall, the
brick balloon, the almond hand (Van Gogh's public-domain *Almond Blossom* as the attached
reference, `engine/assets/refs/` with its `PROVENANCE.json`; `adapt-a-style.md`), the embroidery
loop, the web tour, the butterfly film, the end card); `launch3.ts` is the cut: data segments
spliced with type frames, 77 s on the score's 29 bars. They are anidoodle's own film, so a plain
scaffold leaves them out; `scaffold.mjs <dir> --example` brings them in (with the butterfly they
are built on) to study. Study them for pacing, then build yours on
the template with your own pictures and your own music; anidoodle's launch is one example of the
grammar, not a skin to reuse.
