# Sound design: the effects kit, placed by frame, heard over the score

anidoodle makes its sound effects the way it makes its music: **in code, from nothing**. No samples
or recordings. Every effect is deterministic: the same cue and seed give identical samples.

Code: `engine/src/canvas-core/music/sfxKit.ts` (the kit), `sfxMix.ts` (placement), `sfxCore.ts`
(building blocks). Tool: `engine/tools/sfx.mjs`.

## What makes an effect sound designed, not generated

- **Layers.** Every sound has a transient (the contact: a 1-4 ms filtered noise burst), a body
  (modes of the struck object, a pitch-dropping sine, a friction band) and a tail (a small room from
  `dsp.room`). A single noise burst is not an effect. It is a click.
- **Physics, cheaply.** Plastic, bricks and bells are *modal*: a few damped sines at inharmonic
  ratios. Drops and bubbles ring with a *rising* pitch. A whoosh is a *pass-by*: distance sets
  level and air, radial speed sets the doppler glide (bright coming, darker going), angle sets pan.
  A pen's friction band brightens with stroke speed.
- **Stereo that moves.** Moving sounds travel across the field (`dir: 1` = left to right).
  Hits sit a little off-centre with a Haas offset. Tails are decorrelated.
- **No two hits alike.** Pitch, decay, pan, mode tuning and level (±1 dB) vary per seed. Twenty
  key ticks are twenty different ticks. `mixSfx` gives each cue its own seed from (kind, frame), so
  inserting a cue never changes the others.
- **Tuned where it is tonal.** chime, riser, `press:confirm` and `impact:bloom` follow the film's
  key. A sparkle in the wrong key sounds like a mistake, so there is **no default key or tempo**.
  Pass `plan.score: { piece, tempo? }` (key, bpm and bar come from the film's piece) or set
  `plan.key` / `plan.bpm`. A tuned kind with no key, or a riser with no bpm, throws.

## The kit

`node tools/sfx.mjs list` prints this live. The level is the target loudness over the sound's own
speaking window (K-weighted, see below). Duck is how far the score dips under it.

| kind | variants (first = default) | use it for | level | duck |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tick | key, soft, ui, space | typing, one per character; a UI tick | -20.5 | 0 |
| press | thock, soft, confirm | the Generate button; `confirm` adds a tuned answer | -13 | 2 |
| pop | pop, cork, tiny | something appears; a card lands; a badge | -16 | 1 |
| ink | plip, double, bloom | an ink drop; `bloom` opens an ink-bloom frame | -15 | 2 |
| scratch | nib, pencil, marker | lettering being written (`lengthS` = writing time) | -18.5 | 1.5 |
| paper | slide, flip, rustle | a sheet lands (hit = landing), a page turn (hit = snap) | -18 | 1.5 |
| whoosh | soft, air, fast, deep | something passes the camera (hit = the pass-by) | -16 | 2 |
| swish | in, out, soft | a UI panel or card slides | -17 | 1 |
| riser | soft, air, tonal | THE build into the reveal (hit = its end) | -15 | 2 |
| impact | boom, soft, bloom | THE reveal; `bloom` breathes in first and shimmers in key | -9 | 6 |
| chime | sparkle, bell, glint | magic / success, tuned to the key | -17 | 1.5 |
| bubble | bubbles, splash, gloop | water life, the koi | -16.5 | 1.5 |
| brick | clack, snap, tumble | toy bricks: tap, press onto studs, drop on a pile | -15 | 1.5 |
| thread | pull, pierce, stitch | embroidery: thread through cloth (hit = the tug), the needle | -17.5 | 1.5 |

## Placing effects in a film

Cues are addressed by **film frame**, a whole number (a fractional frame throws; to land a hit
between frames, `snap` it to the beat). The frame is where the sound's sync point lands: the hit;
the pass-by of a whoosh; the landing of a paper slide; the END of a riser. Pre-roll (a whoosh's
approach, a riser's build) is rendered before the frame. If it would start before frame 0,
the plan throws and names the earliest legal frame.

```ts
import { filmSfx, filmAudio, type SfxPlan } from "./music";
import { myScore } from "./myScore";                  // the Piece YOU wrote for this film (README.md)
const score = myScore();
const plan: SfxPlan = {
  fps: 30, frames: 450, score: { piece: score }, beatZeroS: 0, seed: 7,  // key, bpm, bar from the score
  cues: [
    { frame: 12, kind: "tick" },                                          // ...one per typed character
    { frame: 157, kind: "press", variant: "thock", snap: "beat", label: "Generate" },
    { frame: 182, kind: "scratch", variant: "nib", lengthS: 1.4 },
    { frame: 232, kind: "whoosh", variant: "soft", dir: 1 },
    { frame: 400, kind: "riser", beats: 4 },                              // ends ON bar 5
    { frame: 400, kind: "impact", variant: "bloom", snap: "bar" },
  ],
};
export const audio = filmSfx(filmAudio(score, 15), plan);   // Film.audio: score + effects
```

- `snap: "bar" | "beat" | "8th" | "16th"` moves the sync point to the tempo grid (`bpm`,
  `beatZeroS`, `beatsPerBar`). Snap musical moments: the reveal on the bar, a sparkle on the beat.
  Keep UI sounds (typing, clicks) on the picture.
- `beats` sizes a riser in tempo. Its chord pulses in 8ths, then 16ths, then 32nds, and it stops
  on the downbeat.
- Per cue: `variant`, `seed`, `pitch` (semitones), `gainDb`, `dir`, `lengthS`, `duckDb`, `minDb`,
  `label`.
- `mixSfx(music, plan)` returns the mix, the stems (`sfx`, ducked `music`), the duck curve, every
  placed cue and the audibility table. `filmSfx` wraps it for `Film.audio` and **throws on a
  buried cue**.
- One master at the very end: a look-ahead true-peak ceiling at -1 dBTP (`ceilingDb`). The score
  arrives already mastered, so nothing is renormalised.

## Levels and the audibility rule

A cue nobody hears is a bug, not a subtle choice. (The first effects PR sat 13-19 dB under its
music, and its test only checked that they existed.)

- Every cue is measured against the ducked score **at its own moment**. The yardstick is
  K-weighted (BS.1770) loudness over the cue's *speaking window*: the 10 ms frames within 10 dB of
  its loudest, 15-500 ms long. The score is measured over the same window, at least 100 ms.
- **margin = cue - score.** The mix fails if any cue is more than `minDb` under (default **-6
  dB**). Short transients cut through at -3 to -6. Sustained textures (scratch, thread) want -3
  or better.
- To fix a failing cue, raise its `gainDb` first. Raise its `duckDb` only for the moments that
  matter.
- Ducking: the score dips before the cue's window (40 ms raised-cosine attack), holds, and comes
  back over 280 ms (1.2 s after an impact). Typing does not duck. The reveal ducks 6 dB.
- Measured on our own launch film's score (`launchLofi3`: a demo, never a score for your film;
  first 15 s, 33 cues): -15.5 LUFS, -1.9 dBTP, every cue audible. Margins: typing +3 to +8 dB over the intro pad; groove cues -3.5 to +5 dB; the reveal +10.7 dB.

## Taste: when to use effects

- **Effects only on real direction changes.** A press, an appearance, a scene move, a landing.
  Never under every motion, and never a constant bed of whooshes. Silence around a cue is what
  makes it land.
- **One signature riser, one impact per film.** They mark the big reveal. A second riser halves
  both.
- Transitions are gentle moves, so their sound is gentle: `whoosh:soft` and `swish:soft`. Never a
  sharp swoosh.
- Typing is one `tick` per character at the typing cadence, with `space` on spaces. Its level sits
  above the intro and under the groove.
- Put at most two cues in any 100 ms. A thock on the kick merges into the kick, which is lovely
  when it starts the groove and mud anywhere else.
- Hear it in context before it ships. Render the kit page (`node tools/sfx.mjs kit <dir>`) and a
  demo over the real score, and check the audibility table.

## Tools and checks

```
node tools/sfx.mjs list                              # kinds, variants, levels, uses
node tools/sfx.mjs one whoosh soft 3 out.mp3         # one sound
node tools/sfx.mjs kit <dir>                          # every variant x3 + demo + page + meters.json + spectra/
node tools/sfx.mjs test                               # the gate
```

The test checks every kind and variant for:

- determinism (md5 of two renders) and seed variation;
- no NaN, no DC, a peak of -1 dBFS or lower, an end at zero, and no fizz above 20 kHz (a
  16.5 kHz air roll-off is built in);
- a non-silent sound whose level stays stable across seeds.

It also checks:

- the whoosh's doppler and pan travel;
- a chime tuned to its key;
- a riser synced to tempo, and snap-to-beat;
- the demo: deterministic, at film length, true peak within ceiling, every cue audible, the score
  ducked under the impact;
- that a buried cue fails;
- that validation throws clearly on an unknown kind or variant, a pre-roll before frame 0, a bad
  seed, a frame outside the film, a snap without bpm, a bad key, or a pitch out of range.
