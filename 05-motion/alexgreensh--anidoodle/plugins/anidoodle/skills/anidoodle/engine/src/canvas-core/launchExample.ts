// LAUNCH EXAMPLE. A 16-second launch film for a made-up product, built only from the template: two
// prompts answered by two plates drawing themselves, one type frame, the end card on bar 4.
// Copying it: everything here is a PLACEHOLDER. The lighthouse and fox are stock style plates
// standing in; your film's plates are drawn fresh for YOUR product's subject, in the style recipe
// the brief chose (references/styles.md). The film is silent because a score is composed per
// product (references/music/README.md); pass that piece as `score`. bpm comes from the brief.
//   node tools/still.mjs launchExample --frame 0      the first frame is the thumbnail: check it
//   node tools/render.mjs launchExample
