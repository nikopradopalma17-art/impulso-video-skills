// OVERLAY. The engine's src/ and the worked example's example/src/ are ONE tree at build time,
// exactly as scaffold.mjs --example lays them out on disk: a relative import that is not found
// next to its importer is looked for at the same relative place under the other root. The
// example keeps importing "../core"; a launch film can import "./mechanicalLepidoptera" and get
// the committed example. Order matters: engine/src first, so the engine always wins a name clash.
// tsconfig.json says the same thing to tsc with "rootDirs", so the checker and the bundler agree.
